         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:10737:3"/> withall it is a certaine truth, that this heauenly light is in ſome places more reſplendent, in others more obſcure; this candle ſometimes ſhineth ſo clearely, that it giueth light to the whole houſhold, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it burneth ſo dimly, that thoſe only diſcerne it, who haue better inſight, &amp; approch neerer vnto it by diligent ſtudie and meditation.

The which (no doubt) the holy Ghoſt hath purpoſely affected, that neither the great eaſineſſe of holy writ might cauſe in any idle neglect, nor yet the inextricable difficultie might diſcourage any from reading of it; that neither the ſimple plainneſſe thereof might work in the wiſe and learned cauſe of comtempt, ſeeing in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they might haue a fit ſubiect, whereupon they might exerciſe their greateſt learning and deepeſt iudgement; nor the obſcure profoundnes of it might make the ſimple deſpaire of receiuing any fruit by their ſtudies and labours, ſeeing a great part therof is ſo plaine and eaſie, that it is within the compaſſe of a childs capacitie. And finally, as hee hath prouided milke for babes, ſo alſo ſtronger meate for thoſe who are of riper age, that none who are inuited to this heauenly banquet might go away with emptie ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes for want of conuenient food, whereby they ſhould be nouriſhed. Neuertheleſſe the Popiſh crew (who becauſe their works are euill, loue the darknes of ignorance better then the light of Gods truth)
<pb facs="tcp:10737:3"/> take occaſion hereupon to declaime againſt the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuritie of the Scriptures; and to diſſwade all the common people from reading of them; and leſt the ſight of this heauenly food ſhould ſharpen their hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie appetite, &amp; work in them a deſire to feed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, they carefully locke it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ouer whom they haue any authoritie, in the darke cloſet of an vnknowne tongue, that ſo being out of ſight, it may alſo be out of mind; and in ſtead hereof they feede them with their lying Legends, and with the poyſonous hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke of their owne traditions: pretending that out of their great care, they keepe the Scriptures from them, leſt they ſhould peruert them to their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and abuſe them in their ignorance vnto here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and errors. Wherein, what do they elſe, but like cruell nurſes, keepe from Gods children the milke of his word, whereby they ſhould bee nouriſhed, for feare leſt any thereof ſhould droppe vpon their clothes? What doe they elſe, but like hard hearted ſtewards, depriue Gods familie of their allowance, and ſo ſtarue them to auoide ſurfeting? And what doe they by this their either fooliſh or malicious courſe, but quite extinguiſh the light of Gods truth, becauſe it doth not ſhine in all places with like cleareneſſe? But wee who profeſſe our ſelues chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the light, and true diſciples of the ſchoole of Chriſt, muſt be otherwiſe affected, continually pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that though there be nothing but palpable dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in all the dominions of the Romiſh <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> yet this light may ſtill ſhine in our <hi>Goſhen,</hi> as long as the Sunne is in the firmament, and neuer be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. And ſeeing our heauenly ſchool-maſter, in
<pb facs="tcp:10737:4"/> his abundant mercie giueth vnto vs this booke of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine knowledge, which alone is ſufficient to make vs wiſe vnto ſaluation, let vs with the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> take our chiefe delight in this holy learning, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting therein day and night: and when wee finde our leſſon cleare to our vnderſtandings, let vs labour to imprint it in our memories, by the holy vſe and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe which we make of it in our liues and conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: where it is obſcure and difficult, let vs ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to informe our iudgements in the true meaning thereof, by diligent ſtudie and meditation, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one Scripture with another, and clearing thoſe places which are hard and darke, by others which are more eaſie and perſpicuous. Neither doth this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly ſunne, when it is couered with clouds of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuritie, need any earthly meanes to cleare &amp; reſtore it to his brightnes; ſeeing his owne heate and light is ſufficient to diſpell theſe foggie miſts, and the winde of Gods Spirit ſo driueth theſe darke clouds of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from before the eie of our vnderſtanding, that we ſhal need no other helpe for our enlightning.

The conſideration wherof hath moued me, whom the Lord hath called to this fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, though far vnworthie (I ingenuouſly confeſſe)
<pb facs="tcp:10737:4"/> of ſuch high aduancement, to vndertake in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of my calling, the expounding of a part of theſe holy Scriptures, namely, the <hi>Propheſie of Hoſea:</hi> which as it giueth place to none of the writings of the other Prophets in worth and excellencie; ſo in regard of the abſtruſe depth, and obſcure difficultie therof, it doth as much as any other ſtand in need of explanation. In handling whereof I haue chiefely endeuoured to cleare the text from all obſcuritie; and hauing laid open and diſcouered the hidden treaſures therein contained, to communicate and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie them to the inriching of all thoſe, who are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receiue them by their reading and meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The which my labours I deſired ſhould come forth into publike view vnder your Lordſhips patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage and protection, in reſpect of that great loue which you haue ſhewed to learning and religion, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from your tender youth. For howſoeuer you were deſcended of a noble houſe, and from parents of great worth and worſhip, yet you made choice of a ſchollers life, and of the profeſſion of a Miniſter of the Goſpell; which howſoeuer it is in it ſelfe a calling moſt honorable, and beſt repleniſhed with happie contentment; yet is it ſo contemned and vnder va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued by the world &amp; worldly men, that many, much your inferiours, both in birth and meanes, do thinke this profeſſion a great diſparagement to their ſtate and credit. The which alſo would haue diſcouraged you from entring into this calling, had you not with eyes ſpiritually illightned, beheld the inward dignitie and glorie thereof, through the ragged
<pb facs="tcp:10737:5"/> vaile of worldly contempt. And as your loue to learning moued you to enter into this profeſſion, ſo the ſame loue incited you to take ſuch extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary paines in your ſtudies, that I may truely ſay vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mine owne knowledge (being a poore member of that Colledge whereof you were once a chiefe ornament) that ſcarce any of the pooreſt ſchollers (who had no other meanes but learning to aduance either ſtate or credit) did goe before you in vnweari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed paines and induſtrious labour. The which your diligent ſtudies the Lord ſo proſpered with his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, that the plentifull harueſt anſwered and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted the greateſt expectation which could bee had of ſuch an hopefull ſeede time; inſomuch that in the iudgement of the moſt iudicious Vniuerſity, you were thought fit for the greateſt honour, which it could yeeld vnto any, before the ordinary time, which you preuented not onely by nobleneſſe of birth, but alſo through ſufficiencie and deſert: and ſince, haue been thought the meeteſt by our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne King, who is beſt able to iudge of thoſe gifts wherein himſelfe excelleth, to bee his aſſiſtant in his moſt learned ſtudies; and after manifold expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of your great ſufficiencie, to be aduanced vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one of the chiefe preferments which our land affordeth to thoſe, whoſe gifts are of greateſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency; whereby you, who haue alwaies been a louer of learning, are now enabled to be a chiefe patrone of the learned. Of all which I now put you in minde, not in baſe flatterie, which the ſearcher of hearts knoweth my ſoule deteſteth, nor to angle your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb facs="tcp:10737:5"/> by caſting before you the bait of your owne praiſes; but rather to admoniſh you of your dutie towards God, which worldly proſperitie cauſeth vs too often to forget; namely, that with your whole endeuour you ſeeke to honour him, who hath thus highly honoured you; and to imploy thoſe rich talents of learning, authoritie, honour and fauour with your Soueraigne, which your great maſter hath beſtowed on you, to the aduancement of Gods glorie, and the good of his Church, ouer a part whereof you are now made a ſteward and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeer. Otherwiſe, howſoeuer theſe gifts may adorne you in this life, in the eyes of worldly men, yet they will not profit you in the life to come, but rather the greatneſſe of your receits will inlarge the bill of your accounts, in that great and laſt audit, which you muſt make in the preſence of God and his holy Angels. More eſpecially, I entreate your Lordſhip to labour, that in all places where you haue any authoritie and iuriſdiction, God may be glorified in the propagation of his truth, and in the diligent preaching of his Goſpell, which is the ſpirituall ſword and ſcepter of his kingdome, whereby hee raigneth and ruleth in the hearts of men; and to this end, that as much as in you lieth, you will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to plant vnder you a godly, learned and faithfull miniſterie, who may inſtruct the people committed to their charge, in the true religion of Ieſus Chriſt; and to countenance and patronize them being placed, againſt wicked Atheiſts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane worldlings, and idolatrous Papiſts; that ſo
<pb facs="tcp:10737:6"/> vnder the ſhade of your protection, they may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortablie perſiſt in the painfull worke of their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie, and be ſheltered from the ſcorching furie of all oppoſers. So ſhal the Lord inlarge his mercies more and more towards you, perpetuate vnto you an honorable name and memorie amongſt his faithfull ſeruants in this life preſent, and crowne you with endleſſe glorie and immortalitie amongſt his holy Saints in the life to come.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſtian Reader, although the world is alreadie ſo full of Bookes, that a man may ſpend his whole time in reading titles and inſcriptions; yet are there but few amongst this multitude in our Engliſh tongue, which containe ſound expoſitions of the bookes of holie Scriptures; which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God to be the obiect of our faith, and the rule and directorie of our life and manners. In conſideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, as I did in the generall thinke, that no man can better ſpend his labours then in expounding and cleering theſe holie and hidden myſteries; ſo more particularly, that it ſhould be a profitable and acceptable labour, to explaine the <hi>Prophecie of Hoſea;</hi> which as it is exceeding obſcure, and not by any (that I know of) expounded in our tongue, ſo alſo when it is vnderſtood, moſt excellent, and of ſingular vſe for theſe times. And therefore relying my ſelfe vpon Gods aſsiſtance, I haue vndertaken this hard taske, and by his bleſsing haue alreadie proceeded vnto the fifth Chapter. In handling whereof, I haue chiefly laboured to cleere this Scripture from all obſcuritie; and then to informe the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders iudgement, by ſuch inſtructions as naturally ariſe out of the text; and to reforme his affections, life and conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:10737:7"/> by making thereof vſe and application. The which my labours (I may truly ſay) I only intended for the benefit of mine owne priuate charge, and neuer thought of making them publike by the preſſe, till I had finiſhed the three firſt Chapters; when as being perſwaded by ſome of my friends to ſet them out, for the good of others, I began to reſolue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this courſe, yet with a purpoſe not to diuulge any part till the whole were finiſhed. But he who is at the charge of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this booke, herein ouerruled me, perſwading me to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh my readings vpon theſe Chapters firſt, for a taſte of the reſt. Vnto which motion I haue condeſcended, with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to take the like paines in thoſe Chapters which remaine, by the aſsiſtance of God, if I ſhall in the meane while perceiue that this part findeth good acceptation, and ſhall be thought profitable by thoſe who are of better iudgement, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of Gods glorie, and good of his Church, which my deſire is ſhould be the maine end of all my labors. Which that I may the better performe, I intreate, that as I ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to benefit thee with my paines and ſtudies, ſo thou wilt aſsist mee with thy feruent prayers, for the helpe and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Gods holie Spirit in theſe my endeuours, who only can enable vs to expound that, which was firſt preached and written by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine inſpiration.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore I come to expound this our Prophet, I will prefixe ſomewhat, <note place="margin">Why the 12. Prophets are called the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, the other foure the greater.</note> both concerning the twelue Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, of which this our Prophet is one; and alſo concerning the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet himſelfe in generall. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the former, we will conſider in the firſt place, why they are called the ſmaller or leſſer Prophets, the other foure the greater. Not becauſe the other were before them in time; for this our Prophet in this reſpect had the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence of them all, as afterwards ſhall appeare; nor yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they excelled them in dignity and authoritie, for in theſe reſpects alſo this our Prophet giueth place to none of the greateſt: but becauſe the bookes containing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies of the other foure, are much more large then theſe which containe the prophecies of theſe twelue. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, becauſe the dignity and authoritie of the bookes of holy Scriptures is not deriued from their length and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but from God, who is the Author of them, and from the truth which they containe, wee are not to make leſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſhorteſt then of the longeſt, nor of the ſmalleſt Prophet then of the greateſt.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:10737:8"/>
               <p> In the ſecond place let vs conſider, why all theſe twelue <note place="margin">Why theſe were ioyned in one vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume.</note> were originally ioyned in one booke or volume: not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they liued, prophecied and wrote in the ſame time, and ſo ioyned their workes together; for ſome of them were the firſt, ſome the laſt of all the Prophets, whoſe writings are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; ſome before, ſome in, and ſome after the captiuity: but by Gods all-ruling prouidence it came to paſſe, that their prophecies which were written in diuers ages, and ſcattered in diuers bookes, ſhould afterwards bee collected into one volume, to this end, that they might be the better preſerued from loſing and periſhing, to which danger they would haue beene more expoſed, if they had beene ſeuered and ſcattered.</p>
               <p>Where by the way, we may obſerue Gods vigilant care in preſeruing all the writings of his Prophets, Apoſtles, and holy men inſpired by his Spirit, which were neceſſary for the inſtruction and ſaluation of his whole Church and euery member thereof. So that the Church of Rome hath but a ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der argument for their traditions, when as they alledge, that they are inuented to ſupply the defect of thoſe bookes of holy Scripture which are loſt and periſhed.</p>
               <p>The third thing to be conſidered of, is, the ſeuerall people vnto which theſe Prophets prophecied; for ſome propheci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Vnto what people the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied.</note> to the Iſraelites, namely <hi>Hoſea, Ioel, Amos, Micheas;</hi> ſome to the Iewes, as <hi>Zophonias, Haggeus, Zacharias, Malachias;</hi> ſome to the Gentiles, as <hi>Ionas</hi> and <hi>Nahum</hi> to the Niniuites; <hi>Habacuc</hi> to the Babylonians, <hi>Abdias</hi> to the Edomites: the which conſideration is very profitable, as bringing great light to the vnderſtanding of their prophecies.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing which I will conſider, is the generall ſubiect <note place="margin">The ſubiect of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies.</note> or matter which the Prophets handle; the which is partly le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall, and partly Euangelicall. For that which was briefly and ſomewhat darkely ſet downe by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Law, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged and expounded by the Prophets. Firſt therefore they containe holy precepts, preſcribed by God for the guiding and directing of men in the waies of godlineſſe and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe. To which are annexed gracious promiſes of both
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10737:8"/> outward, temporall, and alſo ſpirituall and eternall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites to thoſe that yeelde obedience to Gods Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements; for neither would the Lord haue men to ſerue him for nought, nor yet beſtowe his benefites vpon ſuch as will not vouchſafe him their ſeruice: and therefore as on his part he promiſeth his graces and benefites, ſo he requireth that thoſe vpon whom he beſtoweth them, ſhould liue in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, as it becommeth the people of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they containe reprehenſions and ſeuere threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of grieuous puniſhments againſt the tranſgreſſours of theſe holy precepts, and that both temporall and eternall.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there are intermixed with theſe threatnings of common calamities, ſpeciall conſolations for thoſe who continue in their integrity, and are not carried away with the vniuerſall deluge of wickedneſſe which ouerfloweth the land.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, they foretell the comming of the Meſſias, who ſhould be the Sauiour of the world; for this was the maine end both of the Law &amp; the Prophets, to bring men to Chriſt, in whom (notwithſtanding their imperfections and wants in their legall obedience) they were to be iuſtified, reconciled vnto God, and eternally ſaued.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the maine ſubiect, matter and ſcope of both <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets. The differences which are betwixt <note place="margin">The diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the bookes of Moſes and the Prophets.</note> them are theſe: <hi>Moſes</hi> expoundeth theſe things briefly and darkely; theſe more largely and plainely, as being expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of him. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſetteth downe both the threatnings &amp; the promiſes generally and indefinitely, without limitation of puniſhment, perſon, time, or place: the Prophets ſpecially determine theſe circumſtances, ſetting downe the particular puniſhments which ſhall be inflicted, the perſons againſt whom, the time when and the place where. <hi>Moſes</hi> generally and obſcurely promiſeth that the Meſſias ſhould come, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that a Prophet ſhould bee raiſed by God from among the people, like vnto himſelfe, &amp;c. Deut. 18. 18. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets particularly deſcribe him, what kinde of Meſſias hee
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10737:9"/> ſhould be, namely, that he ſhould be of the Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> of the ſeede of <hi>Dauid,</hi> borne of a virgin, in <hi>Bethlem</hi> of <hi>Iurie,</hi> how hee ſhould liue, and how hee ſhould die for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And ſo much in generall of theſe twelue Prophets: now wee will adde ſomething of this our Prophet <hi>Hoſea.</hi> And <note place="margin">That <hi>Hoſeahs</hi> prophecie is authentical.</note> firſt concerning the authoritie of this prophecie. It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that it was indited by Gods Spirit, and by his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement deliuered to the Church. Firſt, becauſe it is cited and alledged by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and ſo by them appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for canonicall Scripture. So Matth. 2. 15. Out of <hi>Egypt</hi> haue I called my Sonne: ſpoken by <hi>Hoſea,</hi> chap. 11. 1. Matth. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11. 1. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 13. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 25. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 23. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 55. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13. 14.</note> 9. 13. I will haue mercy and not ſacrifice: ſpoken by <hi>Hoſea,</hi> chap. 6. 6. Rom. 9. 25. As hee ſaith alſo in <hi>Hoſea,</hi> I will call them my people which were not my people, &amp;c. Hoſe. 2. 23. 1. Cor. 15. 55. O death I will be thy death; O graue where is thy victory? Hoſ. 13. 14.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the authority of this prophecy is ſufficiently approued by the certainty of the euent, which is a certaine ſigne that it was inſpired by God, and an infallible note to diſtinguiſh true prophecies from thoſe which are falſe. Deut. 18. 21, 22. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 18. 21, 22</note>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be conſidered, is the time in which he prophecied: but of this I ſhall haue occaſion to ſpeake in the firſt verſe of this prophecie.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we are to ſet downe the ſumme of this prophecie, which conſiſteth in theſe points: Firſt, he ſeuerely reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <note place="margin">The ſumme of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie.</note> the ſinnes of the Iſraelites, eſpecially their ſinne of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry: for whereas the Lord had reſtrained his publicke wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſeruice to be performed in the Temple at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> theſe ten Tribes by the inſtigation of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> made choice of two other places, <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel</hi> for this purpoſe, where they erected golden calues and other Idols, and built ſtrange altars, that they might (as the Papiſts doe in their images) worſhippe God in theſe Idols, whereas in trueth, in ſtead of God, they worſhipped the diuell.</p>
               <p>This ſinne of Idolatrie the Prophet ſharpely reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10737:9"/> ſhewing the heynouſneſſe thereof, how odious it is in Gods ſight, the miſerable effects which it produced, and the fearefull plagues and puniſhments wherewith the Lord would puniſh it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hee exhorteth and vſeth diuers arguments to perſwade them to repentance, that ſo they might eſcape theſe plagues and heauie iudgements, ſhewing alſo how they ſhould repent and turne vnto God.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, he prophecieth of Chriſt and of his kingdome, for the comforting of all thoſe who did expect him, and did reſt vpon him for their ſaluation.</p>
               <p>All which points are ſet downe, partly vnder ſhadowes and types, and partly euidently, ſimply, and clearely.</p>
               <p>And ſo much in generall of this prophecie: now I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede <note place="margin">The order in this booke ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued.</note> to the more ſpeciall handling thereof. Wherein I will obſerue this order; firſt I will briefly ſet downe the ſumme or maine argument of euery chapter; ſecondly, I will diuide it into his generall parts; thirdly, I will expound and explane the particular verſes; and laſtly, gather out of them ſuch doctrines and vſes as ſhall offer themſelues to our conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and ſhall be moſt fit for our inſtruction and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore come to ſpeake of the firſt chapter, the <note place="margin">The argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the firſt chapter.</note> maine argument whereof is this. After that he hath prefixed the inſcription, wherein is contained the Author of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, his calling from God, and the time of his prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to the end that hee might make the hearers and readers more attenttiue, hee accuſeth the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> of their ſinnes, and namely of their grieuous Idolatry, vnder the type of an infamous harlot and her adulterous iſſue: ſetting downe withall, comminations of heauy iudgements which the Lord would ſhortly execute vpon them for their ſinnes. To which hee adioyneth a ſingular conſolation to the faithfull; that notwithſtanding the ſinnes and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the rebellious people, the Lord would ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe conſtant in his promiſes which hee made to their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, and would multiply their ſpirituall ſeede in great
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10737:10"/> numbers, making them not onely his people, but alſo his ſonnes and children.</p>
               <p>And this is the argument of this chapter, out of which we <note place="margin">The parts of this chapter.</note> may gather the ſeuerall parts thereof, which are two: Firſt, the inſcription of the prophecie, verſe 1. And ſecondly, the prophecie it ſelfe, in the reſt of the chapter; the which may be diuided into two parts: firſt, legall comminations: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Euangelicall conſolations. In the comminations is ſet downe, firſt the ſinne, verſ. 2, 3. and ſecondly, the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, verſ. 4, 5, 6, 8, 9. The conſolations are firſt proper to the houſe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> verſ. 7. and ſecondly, common to <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> verſ. 10, 11.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>THe inſcription is ſet downe, verſe, 1. <hi>The word of the</hi>

                  <hi>Lord which came to Hoſea the ſonne of Beeri, in the dayes of Vzzia, Iothan, Ahaz, and Hezechia, Kings of Iudah; and in the daies of Ieroboam the ſonne of Ioaſh, King of Iſrael.</hi> This inſcription is prefixed for theſe ends: Firſt, to make the hearer or reader attentiue; in that it is not the word of <hi>Hoſea</hi> himſelfe, or of mortall man, but of the euerliuing God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, to gaine authority vnto, and to ſhew the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted truth and certaintie of this prophecie; in that it is the word of the Lord, not the deuice of man vttered after the things contained therein were come to paſſe, but reueiled to <hi>Hoſea,</hi> and by him to all the people long before the things were accompliſhed, not in an vncertaine time, but in the raigne of theſe Kings here named.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that hereby wee might be helped and furthered in the vnderſtanding of the whole prophecie; for knowing in what time and in whoſe raigne theſe prophecies were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, we may in the bookes of the Kings and Chronicles, reade the ſtory of thoſe times, and ſo come to the knowledge of the ſtate of the Church and Common-wealth vnder the gouernment of theſe Kings, which will giue no ſmall light for the vnderſtanding of the prophecie.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the maine ends of this and the like inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Now let vs come to the words themſelues, wherein
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10737:10"/> are contained foure things. Firſt, the principall efficient cauſe of this prophecie, namely <hi>Iehouah.</hi> Secondly, the matter or maine argument thereof, that is, Gods word. Thirdly, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentall cauſe by whom this word was deliuered, to wit, <hi>Hoſea</hi> the Prophet. Laſtly, the time of the publiſhing of this prophecie, that is, in the raigne of theſe Kings.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt, the principall author of this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, <note place="margin">The Author of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie.</note> is <hi>Iehouah,</hi> who hath his eſſence and being of himſelfe, and giueth being to all creatures. The conſideration whereof ſhould make vs attentiuely to heare, and dutifully to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme obedience to the wordes of this prophecie, both in fleeing the vices therein condemned, and practiſing and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the duties therein commended and commanded vnto vs.</p>
               <p>For it is <hi>Iehouah,</hi> who ſpeaketh vnto vs, who is infinite in wiſedome, and therefore his words are to be imbraced and obeyed, as being moſt fit to guide and rule vs. <hi>Achitophels</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 23.</note> words were receiued as Oracles, becauſe he was wiſe, though his wiſedome was mingled with ſinne and corruption, that is, with fooliſhneſſe; how much more then are we to hearken to God himſelfe ſpeaking vnto vs, whoſe wiſedome is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and moſt perfect?</p>
               <p>It is <hi>Iehouah</hi> that ſpeaketh, who hath his being from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and therefore is eternall, ſo that he euerliueth to reward the obedient, aad puniſh the rebellious.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>Iehouah,</hi> who is immutable, and therefore the ſame faults which he diſliked amongſt the people in the time of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> he miſliketh alſo now; the ſame duties he required of them, he requireth of vs: and as then he multiplied his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies vpon them who heard and obeyed him, and his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vpon thoſe who were rebellious and obſtinate in their ſinnes; ſo hath he now alſo the like mercies and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in ſtore for them who either heare and obey his word, or wilfully neglect and contemne it.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>Iehouah,</hi> who is omnipreſent and omniſcient, and therefore is an eyewitneſſe and beholder of all our actions, yea of our ſecret thoughts and intentions; ſo that he taketh a
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10737:11"/> ſpecial view both of our obedience to reward it, and of our diſobedience to puniſh it. If a iuſt Iudge ſhould alwaies look vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> actions of a malefactor, it would reſtraine him from his wickednes, becauſe hee that ſeeth him hath power in his hand to puniſh him. If a Prince ſhould alwaies behold the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of his ſubiect, he would performe his duty with great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and chearefulnes in hope of reward. But our power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Iudge looketh on vs, and therfore let vs not offend him for feare of puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t; our gratious King beholdeth our ſeruice, and therfore let vs obey his word with chearefull diligence, aſſuring our ſelues y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he will not ſend vs away empty handed.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>Iehouah</hi> that ſpeaketh, who is omnipotent and omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient, and therefore he is able to puniſh vs if we neglect his word, be we neuer ſo mightie; and ſufficient to reward vs and to protect vs from all enemies and other daungers, if we hearken vnto it and obey it.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>Iehouah,</hi> who is not onely in himſelfe infinite in all perfection and the chiefe goodneſſe, but alſo doth commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate this his goodnes vnto his creatures: for in him we liue, and moue, and haue our beeing: Act. 1728. He hath created vs of nothing, and redeemed vs when we were worſe then <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 28.</note> nothing: he hath giuen vs our beeing, and doth preſerue vs that we may continue to bee, multiplying vpon vs all thoſe benefits which are neceſſarie for our health, ſtrength, and welfare; and when notwithſtanding we made the end of our being to be in endleſſe miſerie, he hath procured and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for vs by the price of the precious blood of his beſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, an eternall being in ioy and happines. Seeing therefore <hi>Iehouah</hi> is our Lord by a treble right, both becauſe he hath created and giuen vnto vs our being, and hath redeemed vs that we might euer be in happineſſe, and prouideth all things for vs needfull at his proper charges, protecting vs from all enemies, and deliuering vs out of all daungers: therefore let vs attentiuely hearken to the voice of our Lord, and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſe thoſe duties which he inioyneth vs.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it is <hi>Iehouah</hi> that ſpeaketh vnto vs in this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, who as he hath his being of himſelfe, and giueth being <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 6. 3.</note>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:10737:11"/> to all his creatures, ſo eſpecially to his word, and that both to his promiſes, and alſo to his threatnings. And therefore if we will performe obedience vnto the words of this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, then ſhall we be made partakers of all the gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes therin contained. But if we wil not hearken vnto them, nor ſubmit our ſelues in holy obedience to walke in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but caſt them behind our back, and wilfully go forward in thoſe vices, which in this book are forbidden and condemned, then ſhall all thoſe plagues and puniſhments which are therein threatned fall vpon vs, for the Lord is moſt true of his word, and immutable in the adminiſtration of his mercies &amp; iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments vnto al men, &amp; in al times and ages. And ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> principall cauſe &amp; chiefe author of this prophecie.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be conſidered, is the matter of this <note place="margin">The matter of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, the word of the Lord.</note> prophecie, which he ſaith, is the word of the Lord, that is, the Lords ſpeech or prophecie reuealed to the Prophet <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea.</hi> And this matter or argument is common to all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, yea, to all the Penmen of holy Scriptures, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is vſually prefixed and often repeated in their writings; but in diuers phraſes: as, <hi>The word of the Lord, Thus ſaith the Lord, The viſion of Iſaiah. The burthen which Habacuc did ſee, &amp;c.</hi> which all ſignifie the ſame word of God, ſauing that the word reſpecteth the ſpeaker, viſion the hearer, and burthen ſignifieth the denunciation of ſome heauie puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſon why the Prophets prefix theſe phraſes, is, that they may gaine authoritie to their ſpeeches, and moue their hearers and readers to reuerence &amp; attention, and vnto holy obedience to thoſe things which they deliuer: becauſe they come not in their owne names, but are ſent of God, and haue his ambaſſage put into their mouthes: they ſpeake not according to their owne conceits and inuentions, but the pure and ſincere word of God.</p>
               <p>And to the ſame end doe the Apoſtles likewiſe ſhew their calling from God, &amp; that they ſpeake not their own words, but the words of God. So Rom. 1. 1. <hi>Paul a ſeruant of Ieſus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt, called to be an Apoſtle, put apart to preach the Goſpell of God.</hi> Gal. 1. 1. <hi>Paul an Apoſtle, not of men, neither by man, but</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 1.</note>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:10737:12"/> 
                  <hi>by Ieſus Chriſt and God the father.</hi> And verſe, 11. he affirmeth that the Goſpell which he preached, was not of man, nor receiued nor taught of man, but by <hi>the reuelation of Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> So the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1. Epiſt. 1. 1. <hi>That which was from</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>the beginning, which we haue heard, &amp;c. that declare we vnto you.</hi> And Apoc. 1. 1. <hi>The reuelation of Ieſus Christ, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apoc</hi> 1. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The doctrines which herehence we learne are diuers: firſt, <note place="margin">Gods mercy in ſeeking the conuerſion of ſinners.</note> we may obſerue the endleſſe and boundleſſe mercy of God to his Church and people; who being iuſtly prouoked to wrath againſt them for their ſinnes, doth not ſuddainely powre forth his iudgements vpon them, but giueth long time of repentance, and becauſe he would not haue them ouertaken of his plagues, ſendeth his Prophets to allure them to obedience by gratious promiſes, and to terrifie them from ſininng, by denouncing heauie iudgements. And thus did he deale with the Iſraelites in this place, &amp;c. And the like mercy hath he a long time ſhewed vnto vs, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Out of which we may further gather, that ſo long as hee ſendeth his Prophets, and vouchſafeth his word vnto a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he hath not vtterly reiected them, nor ſhut vp the dore of his mercy againſt them. For to this end he calleth them by his promiſes and threatnings, becauſe he would not the death of a ſinner, <hi>but that hee ſhould repent and liue.</hi> And <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. 23. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33. 10, 11.</note> therefore when the Iſraelites tooke occaſion vpon the threatnings of Gods iudgements denounced againſt them, deſperately to goe on in their ſinnes, becauſe they thought it now too late to repent, becauſe the iudgements of God, who is immutable, were alreadie threatned; and therefore ſhould certainely bee inflicted notwithſtanding their repentance: the Lord ſendeth his Prophet vnto them to tell them, that his threatnings were not abſolute but conditionall, and that when he threatned, he aimed not at their deſtruction, but at their conuerſion and ſaluation. And therfore exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them to repentance, that ſo they might eſcape his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.</p>
               <p>But when the Lord ſtoppeth the mouthes of his Prophets, and bringeth a famine of his word, neither alluring his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10737:12"/> to holy obedience by gratious promiſes, nor reſtraining them from running on in the courſe of their ſinnes by ſeuere threatnings, then are Gods iudgements euen at the dore, and ſuch a people, though neuer ſo ſtrong and ſecure, is nigh vnto deſtruction. Of this iudgement the Lord ſpeaketh, Amos 8. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Amos,</hi> 8. 11. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 3. 26.</note> 11. Ezech. 3. 26. <hi>And I will make thy tongue cleaue to the roofe of thy mouth that thou ſhalt be dumme, and ſhalt not bee to them as a man that rebuketh, for they are a rebellious houſe.</hi> And chap. 7. 26. <hi>Calamitie ſhall come vpon calamitie, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 7. 26, 27</note> 
                  <hi>vpon rumour; then ſhall they ſeeke a viſion of the Prophet, but the law ſhall periſh from the Prieſt, and counſaile from the ancient.</hi> 27. <hi>The King ſhall mourne and the Princes ſhall be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with deſolation, and the hands of the people of the land ſhal be troubled, and I will do vnto them according to their waies, and according to their iudgements will I iudge them: and they ſhall know that I am the Lord.</hi> The accompliſhment of which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie we may ſee, Pſal. 74. 7. <hi>They haue caſt thy Sanctuarie</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74. 7, 8, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>into the fire, and raced it vnto the ground, and haue defiled the dwelling place of thy name.</hi> 8. <hi>They ſaid in their hearts, let vs deſtroy them altogether, they haue burnt all the Synagogues of God in the land.</hi> 9. <hi>We ſee not our ſignes, there is not one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet more, nor any with vs that knoweth how long.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The vſe which wee are to make hereof is, that whileſt the Lord graunteth vnto vs the miniſterie of his word, we praiſe his name for this benefite; and perſwading our ſelues that the Lord hath not yet forſaken vs, let vs bee moued thereby to turne vnto him by vnfained repentance. But if the Lord cauſe the Prophets tongue to cleaue to the roofe of his mouth, and take away from vs the miniſtery of his word, then let vs certainely expect ſome fearefull iudgement, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas he ſaith, that the prophecies of <hi>Hoſea</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie.</note> are the word of the Lord, hence wee obſerue, that they are of great authority and aboue all exceptions, that they are true, certaine, and moſt vndoubtedly to be beleeued, ſeeing they haue God for their author. We are not therefore to eſteeme theſe Prophecies as the conceits of men, but as the word of the moſt true God, inſpired into his Prophets by his holy
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:10737:13"/> Spirit. For we are to know this, that no <hi>Prophecie in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is of priuate motion. For the Prophecie came not in olde time by the will of man; but holy men of God ſpake as they were moued by the holy Ghost.</hi> 2. Pet. 1. 20, 21. So it is ſaid, Luke, 1. 70. That <note place="margin">2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 20, 21. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 70. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 18. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16.</note> God <hi>ſpake by the mouth of his holy Prophets, which were ſince the world beganne.</hi> And the Apoſtle, 2. Tim. 3. 16. ſaith, that <hi>the whole Scripture is giuen by inspiration of God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And as we are thus to eſteeme the words of the Prophets; ſo likewiſe the words of Gods true Miniſters, truely expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and giuing the ſenſe and meaning of the Prophets, and gathering out of them either eſſentially or by neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, ſound doctrines for our inſtruction and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are no leſſe to bee eſteemed the word of God. And hence it is that our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith to his Apoſtles, and in them to all his true Miniſters, Matth. 10. 20. <hi>It is not you</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>that ſpeak, but the Spirit of your father which ſpeaketh within you.</hi> And Luke, 10. 16. <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me, and hee that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>despiſeth you, despiſeth me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas he ſaith, that theſe prophecies are the word of God, we hence gather, that they neede not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation and approbation of men, or of the Church, ſeeing they are confirmed vnto vs by a greater authority, euen of God himſelfe. As therefore Chriſt ſaid of himſelfe, Iohn, 5. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 5. 34.</note> 34. <hi>I receiue not the record of man,</hi> ſo may wee ſay of his word, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we hence learne, that there cannot be a better interpreter of the word of God then God himſelfe, who is the Author of it, and therefore wee are not wholly to depend vpon the interpretation of the Church or Councels, &amp; much leſſe of the Pope, but to expound one Scripture by another; for euery author is the beſt expoſitour of his owne worke, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie lawgiuer of his owne law: and therefore let vs not dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate from God that prerogatiue which wee giue vnto men, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, ſeeing the Scriptures are the word of God, wee hence gather, that they are the beſt rule of our life and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the ſureſt foundation whereupon we may build our
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10737:13"/> faith: ſo that we are not to pinne our faith vpon the Churches ſleeue, becauſe wee haue a <hi>most ſure word of the Prophets, to which we muſt take heede, as vnto a light which ſhineth in a darke place, &amp;c.</hi> as it is 2. Pet. 1. 19. <hi>And are built</hi> (not on the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church) <hi>but of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Ieſus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt himſelfe being the chiefe corner ſtone;</hi> as it is Eph. 2. 20. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 20.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And theſe are the doctrines which concerne all men in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall. More ſpecially, the Miniſters of Gods word may here <note place="margin">That Gods word is the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſubiect of true prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</note> learne to deliuer nothing to the people but the pure word, and what is grounded on it, and warranted thereby; ſo as they may ſay with the Prophets, The word of the Lord, Thus ſaith the Lord, &amp;c. And with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. Cor. 11. 23. <hi>I haue receiued from the Lord that which I alſo haue deliuered</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>vnto you.</hi> And this the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> requireth, 1. Pet. 4. 11. <hi>If any man ſpeake, let him ſpeake as the words of God.</hi> They muſt <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4 11.</note> not therefore deliuer vnto the people in ſtead of Gods word their owne inuentions, their owne frothy conceits of wit, which onely delight and tickle the eare, but neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the iudgement, nor reforme the affections, like plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing muſicke or witty poetry, which are more fit for the ſtage then for the pulpit: they muſt not when they deliuer Gods ambaſſage come <hi>with excellencie of wordes,</hi> or <hi>in the inticing ſpeech of mans wiſedome, which</hi> Paul diſapproueth in his owne <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 1. 4.</note> practiſe, but in the plain <hi>euidence of the ſpirit &amp; of power;</hi> which graue maner of ſpeaking beſt becommeth the ambaſſadours of Ieſus Chriſt. Neither muſt they (vnleſſe it be ſparingly and for ſpeciall purpoſes) cite the authorities of men, of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Doctors, Councels, much leſſe of Poets and Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, labouring to beautifie the pure golden veritie of Gods word, by painting it ouer with the duskiſh colours of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning: whereby they make no difference betweene the Prophets and Apoſtles and other writers, betweene the authority of mans word, and the word of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall God.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſpeciall doctrine concerneth the people, who may here learne, firſt to hunger after the ſincere milke of Gods word, as <hi>Peter</hi> exhorteth, 1. Pet. 2. 2. and not (after the <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2.</note>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:10737:14"/> manner of thoſe who haue itching eares, and cloyed appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites) reiect the word, the foode of their ſoules, becauſe it is brought vnto them in an earthen veſſell, their ſurfetted ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes not ſuffering them to feede vpon any thing which is not ſauced with humane learning.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that when pure doctrine is deliuered vnto them by Gods ambaſſadours, they doe receiue it and eſteeme of it with the Theſſalonians, <hi>not as the word of men, but as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>the word of God, which is the power of God vnto ſaluation to euery one that beleeueth:</hi> as it is, Rom. 1. 16. And therefore <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16.</note> they are to heare it reuerently, and not contemptuouſly; attentiuely, not drouſily, ſleepily, nor carnally, hauing their mindes diſtracted with worldly cares and buſineſſes; and conſcionably treaſuring it vp in their hearts, that they may practiſe it in their liues, not ſecurely and careleſly, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it goe (like the ſand in the houreglaſſe) in at the one eare and out at the other.</p>
               <p>And ſo much concerning the matter of this prophecie. Now we are to ſpeake of the inſtrumentall cauſe by whom it was deliuered, expreſſed in theſe words: <hi>That came vnto Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>That came vnto</hi> Hoſea.</note> 
                  <hi>the ſonne of Beeri.</hi> Wherein is expreſſed the manner how this prophecie was deliuered, and the perſon to whom. The manner, in theſe words; <hi>which came:</hi> that is, the word of the <note place="margin">The manner of reuealing theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies. <hi>Num.</hi> 12. 6.</note> Lord which was deliuered vnto <hi>Hoſea</hi> in a diuine viſion, the which the Prophets vſually ſaw in their dreames whileſt they ſlept: as appeareth, Numb. 12. 6. <hi>If there be a Prophet of the Lord omongſt you, I will be knowne to him in a viſion, and will ſpeake to him by dreame.</hi> So Zach. 1. 8. <hi>I ſawe by night, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zach.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>Iob</hi> 33. 15. <hi>Dan</hi> 7. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>hold,</hi> &amp;c. But how then could the Prophets diſtinguiſh their diuine viſions from ordinary dreames? I anſwer, firſt becauſe the Lord who ſpake vnto them, aſſured them that it was his owne voyce, as appeareth, Acts 16. 9. 10. Secondly, becauſe thoſe who were not ordinary Prophets, had their dreames <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 9, 10. <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. 5. 9. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3 4. <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 32.</note> commonly reiterated; as <hi>Ioſephs,</hi> Gen. 37. 5 9. <hi>Samuels,</hi> 1. Sam. 3. 4. <hi>Pharaohs,</hi> as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> affirmeth, Gen. 41. 32.</p>
               <p>Thirdly they left ſuch a deepe impreſſion as could not be blotted out, as appeareth in the dreame of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10737:14"/> Gen. 40. 6. 8. <hi>Pharaohs,</hi> Gen. 41. 8. <hi>Nebuchadnezzers,</hi> Dan. 2. 4. 2. And theſe are called <hi>ſomnia ſigillata.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 40. 6. 8. <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. 8. <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. 1. 4. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And thus the Lord made knowne his wil vnto his ſeruants in former times. But now wee are not to expect dreames and viſions, for in theſe laſt times <hi>God hath ſpoken vnto vs by his</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Sonne,</hi> Heb. 1. 2. The which is a farre greater mercy vnto vs, then was ſhewed to our Fathers of olde; for whereas they were faine to waite long for the knowledge of Gods will to be reuealed by viſion, and oftentimes were not ſatisfied, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe for the ſinnes of the people the viſion failed, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, 1. Sam. 3. 1. Pſal. 74. 9. wee haue Gods will manifeſted in his written word, which at all times, and vpon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74 9.</note> we may make our counſeller.</p>
               <p>The vſe which we are to make hereof is, that we do not phantaſtically deſire viſions and reuelations, but vſe the meanes which God hath graciouſly graunted vnto vs for the attaining of knowledge, &amp; praiſe his name for it; for they who in the light of the Goſpel deſire viſions, are like thoſe who goe out of the ſunſhine to worke by the light of a dimme candle.</p>
               <p>And ſo much concerning the maner. The perſon to whom this diuine viſion was deliuered, was to <hi>Hoſea,</hi> whoſe name <note place="margin">Of <hi>Hoſea.</hi>
                  </note> is added to manifeſt the truth of this propheſie; for when the writer expreſleth his name, it addeth credit and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to his workes; and therefore <hi>Hoſea</hi> purpoſely profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his name; and the raigne of the Kings in whoſe time he wrote, that it might be manifeſt that his writings were not forged and counterfaite, but the pure word of God.</p>
               <p>The doctrine which we here learne, is, that as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets haue ſet downe many arguments to proue, that that which they haue written, was inſpired by Gods Spirit; ſo we labour to acquaint and confirme our ſelues with them, leſt through ignorance wee imbrace as grounds of our faith, humane conceits for diuine prophecies. And to this dutie the Apoſtle exhorteth <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2. Tim. 3. 14. And the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn,</hi> thoſe to whom he writeth, 1. Iohn 4. 1. Eſpecially let vs <note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 14. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 1.</note> learne to put a difference betweene the apocryphall and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10737:15"/> Scripture, ſeeing the errour is more dangerous, becauſe they are in our Church, ioyned in our bookes, and read promiſcuouſly in the ſeruice of God.</p>
               <p>But let vs come to the name it ſelfe, the ſignification wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is the ſame which <hi>Ieſus</hi> and <hi>Ioſua,</hi> a Sauiour, the which <note place="margin">Of the name <hi>Hoſea.</hi>
                  </note> name was giuen to this Prophet by his parents, directed by the ſpeciall prouidence of God; and doth fitly agree vnto him; firſt becauſe he was a type of our Sauiour Chriſt in his wife of fornications, as afterwards ſhall appeare; ſecondly, becauſe God vſed him as his meanes and inſtrument in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the people by bringing them vnto God from their ſinnes by true repentance, and to their Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt by a liuely faith.</p>
               <p>But how could his parents foreſee this when he was in his infancy? I anſwere, that it was the cuſtome of the Hebrewes to giue vnto their children ſignificant names, whereby either they expreſſed their owne deſires, that their children ſhould be ſuch, and ſo vertuous as their names portended; or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by were put in mind of ſome notable worke of God done about the time of their natiuitie, or of ſome dutie, which by them was to be performed. And ſo this name was giuen to the Prophet by his parents, partly to ſignifie their deſire and hope that he ſhould helpe forward the ſaluation of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and partly to put him in minde of the performance of this dutie.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I ſhewed the ſignification of his name, and the cauſes why it was giuen him. The doctrines which hence we are to learne are theſe. Firſt, whereas this name by Gods all-ruling prouidence is giuen to his Prophet; hence wee learne how we are to eſteeme of Gods true Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Miniſters, namely, as petty or inſtrumentall Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, becauſe God vſeth them as his inſtruments and means for the conuerſion and ſaluation of his people: and this the Apoſtle plainly ſetteth downe, 1. Tim. 4. 16. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 16</note>
               </p>
               <p>But how farre men are from this conceit of Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, appeareth by their vtter neglect of them, neither yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto them the honour of reuerence, nor the honour of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:10737:15"/> maintenance, &amp;c. 1. Tim. 5. 17. The Elders eſpecially which labour in the word and doctrine, are worthy of double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17.</note> And good reaſon, for if our carnall fathers are iuſtly to be honoured which beget vs in the fleſh; how much more our ſpirituall fathers who beget vs vnto God.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, if Gods Miniſters ſaue vs by the miniſterie of the word; and by this liuely ſeede regenerate vs, without which regeneration there is no ſaluation, Iohn 3. 3. Hence <note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 3. 3.</note> we learne highly to prize the Miniſterie of Gods word, and with all reuerence to giue heede vnto it, ſeeing it is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ordinarie meanes of our regeneration and ſaluation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we learne to giue vnto our children ſuch names as may ſignifie our faith hope and earneſt deſire that they <note place="margin">Fit names to be giuen vnto children.</note> may be gracious and vertuous, and alſo put them in minde of ſome good dutie, which when they come to age they are to performe, according to the example of the godly in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times; and not ſuffer them to bee called by heatheniſh and prophane names, whom we deſire ſhould be godly and religious: no, though ſuch names be contained in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: as <hi>Apollos, Fortunatus, Hermes, Tychicus, Syluanus,</hi> and ſuch like: for although ſuch names being giuen, may lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be vſed, becauſe the chiefe end of a name is to diſtinguiſh one from another, yet it is vnlawfull, or at leaſt very inconue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to impoſe them.</p>
               <p>But here it may be demanded, whether it be not lawfull to name our children by our ordinary names, which haue no ſignification. I anſwer, that although thoſe ſignificant names afore ſpoken of, be the beſt and fitteſt; yet I thinke theſe not vnlawfull or inconuenient in ſome caſes: as namely, when as they put vs in minde of ſome of our neere and deere friends called by ſuch names, who haue beene, or are, vertuous and religious; for as the other names ſignifie in themſelues ſome good grace or duty to be performed, ſo theſe put vs in minde of the like in the perſons of our honeſt and godly friends, whoſe example we are to propound vnto our ſelues, for our imitation.</p>
               <p>And ſo much for the Prophets name: he is further deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:10737:16"/> by his parent, that he was the ſonne of <hi>Beeri.</hi> What this <hi>Beeri</hi> was, there is no mention in the Scriptures. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <note place="margin">The ſonne of <hi>Beeri.</hi>
                  </note> as the Hebrewes affirme that hee was that <hi>Beera</hi> mentioned, 1. Chro. 5. 6. It is without warrant; neither hath it any great <note place="margin">1. <hi>Chro.</hi> 5. 6.</note> probability, ſeeing their names are diuerſly written. There is mention alſo of one <hi>Beera,</hi> 1. Chro. 7. 37. of the Tribe of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher;</hi> but neither can this be he, if ancient writers truly affirme <note place="margin">1. <hi>Chro.</hi> 7. 37.</note> him to haue beene of the Tribe of <hi>Iſſachar.</hi> Leauing therefore to ſearch in the darke for that, which if wee found, were not <note place="margin">Hieron. in gl. ord. Iſidor.</note> greatly material: let vs further conſider why mention is made heere of one <hi>Beeri.</hi> Some of the Hebrewes affirme, becauſe he was alſo a Prophet: the which reaſon is grounded vpon a common obſeruation amongſt them; that where the father of the Prophet is named, we are to conceiue that he alſo was a Prophet. Where the grandfather is alſo mentioned, it is to ſignifie the dignitie and honour of his ſtocke. The like rule they haue vnto this; namely, that where no mention is made of his countrey, we are to conceiue that hee was a Citizen of <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> But theſe obſeruations being preſſed vpon vs without any reaſon, may without reaſon alſo bee denied: eſpecially ſeeing it is their vſuall cuſtome ſtifly to affirme that which they weakely, or not at all proue.</p>
               <p>Others affirme, that mention is made of his father, becauſe he was of famous and honourable parentage, that hereby his <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 26, 27, 28.</note> prophecie might receiue more authoritie and credit. But this likewiſe hath no ground; nay, contrariwiſe we know, that it is not the manner of Gods Spirit, to ſeeke authority vnto his writings from the nobility of his penmen, but rather ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his wiſedome in mans fooliſhneſſe, and his glory in mans baſeneſſe, that God may be all in all.</p>
               <p>Leauing therefore others opinions, who leaue the light of Gods word, and grope for the trueth in the darkeneſſe of their owne inuentions, the likelieſt cauſe why the Prophets father is here named, is, that hee might bee diſtinguiſhed from others of his name; for foure names being common to many, ſurnames were added to put a difference betweene one and another, which amongſt the Hebrewes were vſually
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:10737:16"/> taken from their fathers and grandfathers, as the manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Welchmen is at this day. So <hi>Simon</hi> was called <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 24.</note> to diſtinguiſh him from <hi>Simon</hi> the Cananite: <hi>Iames</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Zebedeus,</hi> to diſtinguiſh him from <hi>Iames</hi> the ſonne <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Verſe</hi> 2, 3.</note> of <hi>Alpheus.</hi> Whereby alſo it appeareth, that this was vſuall, not onely when they were of noble, but alſo of meane and poore parentage.</p>
               <p>And ſo much concerning the inſtrumentall cauſe of this <note place="margin">The time wherein <hi>Hoſea</hi> prophecied.</note> prophecie. In the laſt place wee are to obſerue the time, wherein and how long hee prophecied, expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>In the daies of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah; &amp;</hi> c. That is, in the raigne of theſe Kings of <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or in the yeares wherein they <note place="margin">In the daies of <hi>Vzziah,</hi> &amp;c.</note> raigned; which by a figuratiue ſpeech common with the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes, is called daies, becauſe raignes, times, and yeares conſiſt of daies.</p>
               <p>The Kings of <hi>Iudah,</hi> in whoſe time <hi>Hoſea</hi> prophecied, are foure; <hi>Vzziah, Iotham, Ahaz, Hezechias:</hi> of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> one onely is mentioned, namely <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> who is ſaid to be the ſonne of <hi>Ioaſh,</hi> to diſtinguiſh him from <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Nabat,</hi> who firſt vſurped the Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Not that hee raigned onely all this time, for <hi>Hoſea</hi> prophecied in the time of fiue other Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (if they may be all called Kings, ſeeing ſome of them were tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call vſurpers) to wit, <hi>Zachariah, Shalem, Menahem, Pekahi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, Pekah,</hi> and as it is very probable in the daies alſo of <hi>Hoſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah:</hi> but mention is made of him, that light might be giuen to the Cronologie, &amp; that it might appeare how long <hi>Hoſea</hi> prophecied, as we ſhall ſhew afterwards.</p>
               <p>The cauſes why mention is here made of the raigne of theſe Kings are. Firſt, to ſhew the certaintie of this prophecy, in that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> particular time wherin it was deliuered is ſpecified.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe in Cronologies no fitter courſe can be taken for the numbring of times and yeares wherein things were done, then by the raignes of Kings; becauſe the time by this meanes is better obſerued and remembred; Kings raignes, and the things done by them, being often repeated in common diſcourſe.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:10737:17"/>
               <p> Thirdly, becauſe it giueth light vnto the vnderſtanding of the prophecie, by hauing recourſe to the hiſtorie of theſe Kings; where vnderſtanding their diſpoſition, life, &amp; actions, wee may thereby gueſſe at the ſtate and condition of the <note place="margin">Regis ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplem, totus componitur orbis.</note> times and people ouer whom they raigned; ſeeing the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect either for feare or fauour, vſually imitateth and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth himſelfe to the nature, diſpoſition, and behauiour of his Prince.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that it might appeare that theſe prophecies were not deliuered for priuate ends and reſpects, but for the publike vſe and profite, as well of their people as of their Princes, that all with one accord, both by Gods ſweete pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, and ſeuere threatnings, might bee brought vnto true repentance.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, that we might know how long the Lord vſed the conſtant miniſterie of his Prophet, in mouing the people to <note place="margin">How long <hi>Hoſea</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied.</note> forſake their ſinnes, before he would inflict the puniſhments which they deſerued; the which may be gathered out of this Cronologie of the raigne of theſe Kings of <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Iſrael.</hi> For <hi>Vzziah,</hi> who is called alſo <hi>Azariah,</hi> raigned two and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeares, in whoſe raigne hee beganne to prophecie: and leſt we ſhould thinke that hee beganne to prophecie in the latter end of his raigne, he addeth alſo, that hee prophecied in the daies of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> who raigned one and forty yeares ouer <hi>Iſrael.</hi> 2. King. 14. 23. And in the ſeuen and twenty yeare of his raigne, began <hi>Vzziah</hi> to raigne ouer <hi>Iuda.</hi> 2. King. 15. <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 14. 23.</note> 1. So that if we reckon but from the laſt yeere of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> it <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 15. 1.</note> will appeare that <hi>Hoſea</hi> prophecied in the time of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah,</hi> thirty ſeuen or almoſt thirty eight yeares: to theſe if wee adde the time of <hi>Iothams</hi> raigne, which was ſixteene yeeres, 2. King. 15. 33. And of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> which was ſixteene yeeres more, 2. King. 16. 2. it commeth in all to 69. or 70. yeares. <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>.</note> Now it is likely, ſeeing mention is made of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that hee prophecied alſo in ſome part of their raigne; and according to <hi>Ieromes</hi> iudgement, he prophecied fiue yeares vnder the raigne of <hi>Ezechias.</hi> For as hee ſaith of him, he did foreſee the future, and bewailed the preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:10737:17"/> of the Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> which was effected by <hi>Salmanaſſer,</hi> in the ſixt yeare of <hi>Ezechias</hi> raigne. To all which time, if wee adde ſome yeeres of <hi>Ieroboams</hi> raigne, it will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount in all almoſt to eighty yeeres.</p>
               <p>For whereas ſome imagine, that the yeeres of <hi>Iothams</hi> raigne, are to be numbred with the yeeres of his father <hi>Vz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah,</hi> becauſe in his time he being ſtrucken with leproſie, <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi> gouerned in his fathers ſtead; it is very probable, that beſides this time, he raigned after his fathers death ſixteene yeeres. For it is not ſaid, that he raigned as King while his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liued; but that hee <hi>gouerned his fathers houſe, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the people of the land.</hi> 2. King. 15. 5. 2. Chronicles 26. 21. Namely, as Vice-roy, or his fathers Lieuetenant or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie. <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 15. 5. 2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 26. 21</note>
               </p>
               <p>The doctrines which we hence gather are diuers. Firſt, we <note place="margin">Gods mercy in affording to his people the meanes of ſaluation.</note> may obſerue Gods infinite mercy towards this people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who before he would deſtroy them, as their ſinnes deſerued, he continued this and other of his Prophets mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery for a long time together; to the end that they might be turned vnto him by true repentance, and ſo eſcape his iuſt iudgements threatned. Of this mercy we haue the like example in the daies of <hi>Noah,</hi> before the captiuity of <hi>Iuda;</hi> and the vtter deſtruction of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in the times of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; and in our owne daies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we may obſerue the obſtinate wickednes, and inflexible obdurateneſſe of this people; who notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">The hardnes of the peoples hearts.</note> this mercy of God, and meanes of their conuerſion, continued in their ſinnes without repentance. The which obſtinacie and rebellion, is not proper vnto them, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with vs in theſe times, wherein we ſtubbornely refuſe the like, or greater mercy, and make no profitable vſe of far greater meanes which God hath giuen vs for our conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But if we continue in the hardneſſe of our hearts, let vs not expect or hope for immunitie of puniſhment: for as in the time of this Prophet, after the people had long contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Gods mercy, he brought vpon them his fearefull iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: ſo will he deale with vs, &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:10737:18"/>
               <p> The vſe which we are to make hereof, is, that ſeeing our hearts are ſo hard and inflexible, we doe not onely labour to bruiſe them by the hammer of Gods word, and by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying vnto them the threatnings of the Law: but ſeeing this is not ſufficient, in reſpect of their more then adamantine hardneſſe, we are often to implore the aſſiſtance of Gods holy Spirit; for that onely is that precious oyle whereby they are ſuppled, ſoftned, and made plyable to Gods will.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we may heare obſerue the painefull diligence, <note place="margin">The patience and diligence of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</note> and vnwearied patience of the Prophet, who for the ſpace of ſo many yeeres continued his laborious miniſterie, and that not with a religious and obedient people, which might haue yeelded vnto him ſome comfort and incouragement, when as he did ſee the fruit of his labours; but with an idolatrous and ſtiffe necked nation, who ſcorned and deſpiſed his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof ſerueth to ſtirre vs vp to follow his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in our ſeuerall places and callings, though they ſeeme te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and toileſome vnto vs; eſpecially Gods Miniſters haue here a patterne of diligence and painefulneſſe, for their imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: which that they may imbrace and follow, they are often to call to minde the recompence of reward promiſed. Dan. 12. 3. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe the hearers of Gods word may here learne, patiently to harken to the word of exhortation and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion; and not to waxe wearie and tired, though Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters doe for many yeares together inueigh againſt their ſinnes, and denounce Gods iudgements due vnto them; as the cuſtome of many is, who though they be neuer wearie of ſinning, yet they are preſently weary of hearing their ſinnes reprehended.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we are to obſerue, that this our Prophet was ſent as Gods ambaſſadour when he was but young, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued <note place="margin">No age ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from Gods ſeruice.</note> it vntill his old age. Whence we learne, that no age is exempted from Gods ſeruice, nor any time ſo vnfit, but that if it pleaſe the Lord to grant the aſſiſtance of his Spirit, a man may in it aduance the glory of God, and benefit the Church.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:10737:18"/> And therefore we may not excuſe our ſelues by our youth, as though it were not time for vs to begin to ſerue God; nor by our age, as though that ſhould exempt vs from Gods ſeruice, as being too painefull and laborious; but as we are to beginne betimes, ſo we are to hold out to the end, ſeeing nothing is more <hi>honourable then a gray head in the waies of righteouſneſſe.</hi> Pro. 16. 30. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 16. 30.</note>
               </p>
               <p>More eſpecially the people may here learne, not leſſe to <note place="margin">The youth of Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters not to be deſpiſed.</note> eſteeme Gods ambaſſage, by reaſon of the youth of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, ſeeing the Lord hath called both young and old, and fitted the one as well as the other for this ſeruice; to the end that we ſhould not reſt and depend vpon the perſon of the Miniſter, but vpon his owne ordinance, the miniſterie of his word, and on the bleſſing of his holy Spirit, whereby onely it is made effectuall for our ſaluation. <hi>Ieremy</hi> was but <hi>a childe,</hi> that is young in yeares, when he was called to be a Prophet, Ier. 1. 6. but yet he muſt not be afraid to ſpeake to <note place="margin">

Tim. 4. 12. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Hoſea</hi> prophecied in his young daies, but they were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed hereby who would not heare him; nor exempted from feeling Gods iudgements.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, we may here obſerue, that he did prophecie the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine <note place="margin">The ruine of Iſrael foretold, when it moſt flouriſhed.</note> of the kingdome of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not in the declining ſtate thereof, but in the raigne of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> vnder whom it moſt flouriſhed, when there was no appearance of ſuch future ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, as were foretold by the Prophet; for <hi>Iehoaſh</hi> his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had gotten the vpper hand of <hi>Amaziah</hi> King of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and had carried away the treaſures of the Temple and the Kings houſe; and <hi>Ieroboam</hi> himſelfe hauing obtained many notable victories againſt his enemies, inlarged the borders of the kingdome to her ancient limits. So that now, the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry of thoſe times might be defended, in that it had more proſperous ſucceſſe, then the pure worſhippe of God in the kingdome of <hi>Iuda:</hi> but in theſe times God ſendeth his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, being young of yeares, to reproue King and people
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:10737:19"/> for their idolatrie, and to denounce and foretell the vtter ſubuerſion of the kingdome.</p>
               <p>Where firſt we may obſerue the vndoubted truth of this prophecie, ſeeing he could by no other meanes, but by the inſpiration of Gods Spirit, attaine to the knowledge of the ruine of the Kingdome, when in reſpect of the preſent flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing eſtate thereof, there was nothing leſſe feared or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas it is ſaid, that the Prophet propheſied <note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage.</note> in the time of <hi>Ieroboam;</hi> and in that flouriſhing eſtate of the kingdome foretold the ruine thereof: hence we obſerue that notable boldnes, and couragious fortitude of this Prophet, who durſt vndertake and go through a matter of ſuch great difficultie and danger: For ſeeing the victorious King and people, were made drunke with proſperitie, exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lifted vp in pride in their good ſucceſſe, and long hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with their cuſtomable liuing in all maner of wickednes, it may eaſily be gueſſed, with what ſcoffes and taunts, they entertained the Prophet; and vnto how many dangers hee expoſed himſelfe, where he prophecied of their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which they not ſo much as feared.</p>
               <p>The which ſerueth to teach Gods Miniſters in theſe times, boldly and couragiouſly to deliuer Gods embaſſage, euen before Kings and great Potentates, when they are called hereunto; and not to be daunted with the face of man, when they ſpeake in the place of God; nor to be diſcouraged with ſcoffes, taunts, and reproches, difficulties and dangers, which they vndergo in performing their dutie; for hee that hath ſet them on worke, will giue them their wages; ſo that they ſhal not ſuffer the leſt thing for his ſake, which he wil not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence an hundred fould.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wee obſerue Gods maruelous and miraculous preſeruation of this his Prophet, in the middeſt of all theſe <note place="margin">Gods power in preſeruing his Prophet.</note> dangers, for the ſpace of many yeeres together; ſo that though he was compaſſed about with wicked men; and was vnder the gouernment of Idolatrous Kings, againſt whoſe idolatrie he inueighed, yet God deliuered him in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:10737:19"/> of all theſe perils, and brought him in peace in his very old age, vnto his graue, as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> writeth.</p>
               <p>The conſideration whereof, ſhould encourage Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, to goe on in the performance of their dutie, euen through the middeſt of dangers, ſeeing the ſpeciall proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God watcheth ouer them, and will preſerue them in their waies, though it ſeeme neuer ſo impoſſible, ſo farre forth, as God thereby may be glorified, and their ſaluation furthered. Examples of this marueilous preſeruation, wee haue in <hi>Noah, Lot, Moſes, Elias, Iohn</hi> the Euangeliſt, <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Luther,</hi> and many others.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in the example of this Prophet, Gods Miniſters <note place="margin">Vices are to be reproued when they moſt proſper.</note> may learne, to ſet vpon and inueigh againſt vices, not onely when they are diſcountenanced with Gods iudgements, and vnder foote, but then moſt eſpecially, when they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with moſt proſperous ſucceſſe, and do ſeeme to be approued by God, in regard of that peace and proſperitie, which doth attend vpon them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, heere we learne, that we are not to iudge of Gods loue and fauour, nor of the vertues, and religious godlineſſe <note place="margin">Proſpertie no true ſigne of Gods loue.</note> of a State, by their good ſucceſſe, and proſperous affaires; for vnder the gouernment of this King <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> ſuch was the eſtate of this kingdome and people; and yet the Lord ſendeth his Prophet, to ſhew them that they were out of his fauour, and that he would diuorce them from him, for their manifold adulteries: that their religion which was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with proſperitie, and all worldly felicite, was falſe, ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous, and ſuperſtitious, and that they abounded in all ſin and wickedneſſe.</p>

               <p>The time or order in theſe words <hi>(At the beginning)</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. At the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</note> which ſome expound, that the Lord firſt ſpake vnto this Prophet, before he ſpake vnto any of the reſt, and ſent him to prophecie vnto the people, before any of the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. But this being generally vnderſtood, is not true, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before he had ſpoken to many, as to <hi>Abraham, Noah, Elias, Elizeus,</hi> &amp;c. And if more particularly we vnderſtand it of the Prophets of his time, whoſe writings are extant, it is not probable that <hi>Hoſea</hi> was firſt, but rather <hi>Ionas,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied in the beginning of <hi>Ieroboams</hi> raigne, and did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell all his famous victories, as appeareth, 2. King. 14. 25. <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 14. 25.</note> whereas it is very likely, that <hi>Hoſea</hi> prophecied not vntill the latter end, vnleſſe we would ſay that he prophecied 100. yeares, for ſo much it is almoſt from the beginning of <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boams</hi> raigne, to the beginning of <hi>Ezechias.</hi> And moreouer it is heere ſaid, verſ. 4. that the iudgements threatned by <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea,</hi> ſhould within a little while be inflicted, which was not in <hi>Ieroboams</hi> raigne, but in his ſonnes, and thoſe who ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him. Theſe words therefore, are rather thus to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that this was the beginning of the Lords ſpeech vnto <hi>Hoſea;</hi> or that the Lord thus began his ſpeech vnto <hi>Hoſea,</hi> when he called him to be his Embaſſadour vnto the people: and this the Hebrew text will well beare, for it may as well be tranſlated thus: <hi>The beginning of the Lords ſpeech, as at the beginning the Lordſpake,</hi> ſeeing the word may indifferently be either noune or verbe.</p>
               <p>The Commander is <hi>Iehouah,</hi> who doth not ſpeake vnto <note place="margin">The Lord ſpake to <hi>Hoſea.</hi>
                  </note> the people immediately by his owne voice, but by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Hoſea:</hi> the word in the originall ſignifieth that the Lord
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:10737:20"/> ſpake in <hi>Hoſea;</hi> which ſome expound, that the Lord ſpake vnto <hi>Hoſea;</hi> ſome, that he ſpake with <hi>Hoſea;</hi> ſome, that he ſpake by <hi>Hoſea:</hi> but ſomewhat more is here to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; namely, that he ſo ſpake by him, as that alſo he ſpake in him, prompting him as it were by his Spirit, what hee ſhould deliuer from him to the people. In the firſt verſe it is ſaid, that <hi>the word of the Lord came to Hoſea:</hi> by which we are to vnderſtand, not onely that the Lord barely ſpake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Prophet, for ſo the Lord alſo ſpeaketh to all whom he inſtructeth by his word; but that he ſpake vnto him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by himſelfe, and not as vnto an ordidary man, but as vnto his Prophet, whom he ſent as his ambaſſadour vnto the people, with his word in his mouth, which he was to deliuer vnto them, as in Gods owne perſon. Here it is ſaid, that the Lord ſpake not onely to him, and by him, (for he ſpake alſo by <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſſe vnto his Maſter, vſing him as his inſtrument to reproue the Prophets folly) but alſo that he ſpake in him, becauſe the Spirit of God dwelling in him, directed his tongue; ſo that he deliuered nothing according to his owne inuentions, but the pure word of God. The like phraſe is vſed, 2. Sam. 23. 2. Haba. 2. 1. Heb. 1. 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Cor. 13. 3. <hi>Seeing ye haue experience of Chriſt that ſpeaketh in me.</hi> Matth. 10. 20. <hi>For it is not you that ſpake, but the ſpirit of your Father which ſpeaketh in you.</hi> By all which places it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, that God dwelling in his Prophets, Apoſtles, and Miniſters by his holy Spirit, doth vſe them as his inſtruments in his owne ſtead, to deliuer his word vnto his people.</p>
               <p>In the words following he addeth; <hi>That the Lord ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hoſea:</hi> which hath relation vnto the ſpeciall commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which enſue. So that here is ſomewhat more to be vnderſtood then was expreſſed in the firſt verſe, namely, that the Lord did not onely ſpeake vnto the Prophet generally, but that hee thus ſpake after this ſpeciall manner, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of the firſt wordes of this verſe; the ſumme whereof is this: that the Lord, when as he called <hi>Hoſea</hi> to be a Prophet, put his word into him, and ſpake in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:10737:21"/> him and by him, as his Ambaſſadour, who repreſented his owne perſon: and for the beginning of his ſpeech, cauſed him to vſe the words following vnto the people.</p>
               <p>Now let vs come to the doctrines and inſtructions which ariſe out of theſe words. Firſt, here we obſerue, that before <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The do∣ctrines. </seg>
                  </label> the Lord ſendeth <hi>Hoſea</hi> to ſpeake vnto the people, he firſt ſpeaketh vnto the Prophet, and putteth his ambaſſage into <note place="margin">God furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all whom he ſendeth on his Embaſſage.</note> his mouth, preparing and fitting him vnto this great worke vnto which he called him. From whence we learne, that all who are called of God to the worke of the miniſtery, are firſt by him ſo furniſhed with the gifts of his Spirit, that they are in ſome good ſort enabled to deliuer Gods word and meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage vnto the people. And this is apparant through the whole courſe of the Scriptures: for thoſe who were after an extraordinarie manner called, were alſo extraordinarily fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for this worke; as the Prophets, and Apoſtles: thoſe who had an ordinary calling, were prepared by ordinarie meanes, as in the ſchooles of the Prophets; as the vſe alſo is ſtill amongſt vs at this day.</p>
               <p>Whereby it appeareth, that thoſe blinde guides, and dumbe Miniſters which in theſe times abound, were not ſent of God: for if an earthly Prince will not make choyce of an ignorant and ſpeechleſſe Ambaſſadour, much leſſe will God, infinitely wiſe, make choyce of ſuch meſſengers; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering that hee is in himſelfe able to furniſh any whom he ſendeth, with ſufficiency of gifts fit for that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vnto which he calleth them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we may obſerue, that the Prophet doth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the worke of his Calling, before he is after a ſpeciall <note place="margin">An outward Calling neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note> manner ſent from God, although hee was furniſhed with gifts, and had his minde illuminated by the Lord, ſpeaking to him and in him. From whence we learne, that we are not to thruſt our ſelues into this Calling, though wee had great knowledge and learning, vnleſſe we be firſt called and ſent by God; which extraordinarily was done by God himſelfe to the Prophets and Apoſtles immediately; and ordinarily, by the Church, or thoſe which by the Churches conſent are
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:10737:21"/> appointed for this purpoſe. For though Chriſt had inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his Apoſtles, yet they preach not till he ſendeth them. Matth. 10. 5. Though <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt was ſtrong in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 5.</note> yet he remained in the wilderneſſe as a priuate man, <hi>till the appointed time came that he ſhould ſhew himſelfe vnto Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi> Luke 1. 8. Yea, though our Sauiour Chriſt had the Spirit <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 8.</note> of God, and the gifts thereof without meaſure; yet he execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not his publike miniſtery till the day which God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed came, and til he was prepared thereunto by his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie daies faſt. Matth. 4. None of the Paſtors and Doctors <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.</note> might take vpon them to diſcharge the works of thoſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, till they were allowed of the Church by the impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hands. 1. Tim. 4. 14. 5. 22. Thoſe therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which are Gods true Prophets, as they are furniſhed with gifts, ſo they <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 15. <hi>and</hi> 5. 22.</note> haue Gods ſpeciall warrant and calling, before they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the execution of their office. And contrariwiſe, to ſpeake before God ſendeth, is a note of a falſe Prophet, as appeareth, Ier. 23. 21. <hi>I haue not ſent theſe Prophets</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>yet they ranne, I haue not ſpoken to them, yet they prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ier.</hi> 23. 21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14. 13. 27. 15. 28. 8, 9. Gods loue to his Prophets.</note> Ier. 14. 13, 14. 27. 15. 28. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we may obſerue, that before the Lord executed thoſe puniſhments vpon the people which their ſinnes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, he firſt reuealeth his will vnto his Prophets. Whence we learne Gods ſpeciall loue towards them and their digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, in that the Lord maketh choyce of them, to be as it were his priuie counſellers, without whoſe knowledge he will do no worke of great importance: according to that, Amos 3. 7. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Amos,</hi> 3. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord will doe nothing, but he reuealeth his ſecret to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants the Prophets.</hi> The practiſe whereof wee may ſee to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Abraham.</hi> Gen. 18. 17. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 17.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, whereas the Lord vſeth the miniſterie of his <note place="margin">The benefit of the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to both Teachers and people.</note> Prophet, for the manifeſtation of his will; hereby he decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his great mercy and goodneſſe, both to the Prophets and people: to the Prophets, in that he vouchſafeth them this dignitie, to be his Ambaſſadours and Miniſters of our recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God, and eternall ſaluation; which office be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed alſo to his moſt dearely beloued Sonne. In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:10737:22"/> the Apoſtle ſaith; that they were <hi>co-workers with Chriſt.</hi> 2. Cor. 6. 1. To the people to whom he appointeth the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1.</note> of man like vnto themſelues; becauſe in reſpect of their ſinne and corruption, they could not indure the glorious voice of God, vnleſſe this glorious maieſtie were as it were veiled and ſhadowed with the miniſtery of man; as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by their ſuit made vnto God. Exod. 20. 19. The which is graciouſly granted. Deu. 18. 16, 17. And becauſe we could <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 19. <hi>Deu.</hi> 18. 16. 17</note> not conceiue and vnderſtand his glorious and moſt wiſe ſpeech, he hath appointed his Miniſters, that they, like nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in their childiſh and broken language, which is moſt fit for our capacitie, might inſtruct vs in the knowledge of Gods will.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, whereas it is ſaid, that the Lord ſpeaketh in the Prophets; we learne, with what feare, reuerence, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">Reuerence required in hearing the word.</note> we are to heare and receiue the word of God; in that the Lord himſelfe ſpeaketh vnto vs by them, and vſeth their mouth and tongue as his inſtrument, and as it were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of his minde: as it is, Luke 1. 70. And in that they are Gods Ambaſſadours, repreſenting vnto vs his perſon, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 70.</note> and in Chriſts ſtead bring vnto vs the glad tydings of the Goſpell, and of our reconciliation with God. 2. Cor. 5. 20. <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20.</note> Whom if wee receiue, wee receiue Chriſt himſelfe: whom if we contemne, wee contemne not man, but the euerliuing God: as appeareth, Luke 10. 16. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, whereas he ſendeth the Prophet with ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements <note place="margin">Gods mercy in denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> to the people, to ſhew vnto them their ſinne, and to denounce ſuch puniſhments as by them they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued: We are to obſerue a double mercy of God towards his Church. For firſt before he will puniſh them, hee giues them warning, that by their repentance they might preuent his iudgements threatned. And ſecondly, if they went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in their ſinnes, till the puniſhments were inflicted, they might then call to minde who puniſhed them; to the end, that then at the leaſt, they might forſake their ſinnes, and turne vnto the Lord by true repentance, that ſo hee might haue mercy vpon them. Where as otherwiſe (ſuch is our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption)
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:10737:22"/> they would neuer looke vnto the hand of God cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting them, nor conſider the cauſe of their puniſhment, but aſcribe all, either to chance &amp; fortune, or to ſome inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our cauſe, and ſo goe forward in their ſinnes, to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>And ſo much concerning the commander, and the perſon <note place="margin">Goe take vnto this a wife of fornications.</note> commanded. Now wee are to ſpeake of the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelfe, which is inioyned vnto the Prophet: which is, that he ſhould goe and take vnto him a wife of fornications, &amp;c. where firſt we are to cleare that queſtion of great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie which hath troubled many; namely, whether the <note place="margin">Whether <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to marrie an harlot; or but in viſion only.</note> Lord inioyned the Prophet indeede and truth to take to wiſe an infamous harlot; or whether it were a viſion onely, and to be propounded by the Prophet, by way of parable to the people. Many thinke that it was inioyned by the Lord to be done indeede, and that it was accordingly performed actually: to which iudgement, they are moued by the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward letter of the text. And amongſt theſe expoſitors are generally the Papiſts, whoſe cuſtome is to expound things done, by allegories: and allegories and parables as things done: though innumerable abſurdities follow thereupon. But that this was onely ſhewed to the Prophet by viſion, and inioyned that by way of parable he ſhould declare it to the people, it appeareth plainely by theſe reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe God commandeth nothing which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie <note place="margin">Reaſons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that the Prophets ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in viſion.</note> to honeſtie, the law of nature, and good manners; but that the Prophet of God ſhould marrie with an infamous and common harlot, is contrarie to all theſe; and therefore God did not command it actually to be done, but onely by way of parable.</p>
               <p>But againſt this is obiected, that God commanding it, it becommeth honeſt and lawfull. I anſwere, that this is to beg that which is in queſtion: neither doth God command euill and vnlawfull things, that ſo they may become good and honeſt; but his will being the rule of goodneſſe and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, doth onely command things good and iuſt; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ſo to be eſteemed, becauſe not onely they are
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:10737:23"/> good and iuſt in their owne nature, but alſo becauſe he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and commandeth them.</p>
               <p>But it is further vrged that God commanded the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, to ſpoile the Egyptians of their gold, ſiluer, &amp; iewels: and therefore ſeeing the commandement of God made that action lawfull, which otherwiſe would haue been theft in the people of Iſrael; therefore the like commandement might make this mariage of the Prophet lawfull, which in it ſelfe was vnhoneſt and vnlawfull. To which I anſwere that there is great diſſimilitude in theſe two examples: for firſt God the ſoueraigne Lord and chiefe owner of heauen and earth, and all that in them is, in his own right and by his ſole authority, might take that which was his owne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one, and giue it to another. Secondly, this action was lawfull by the law of nature and nations, that thoſe who had long ſerued them as bondmen, ſhould haue ſome reward for their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; which becauſe they tyrannically withheld, the Lord like a Soueraigne monarch and iuſt iudge, righted the cauſe of the oppreſſed, and appointed vnto them this wages for their tedious ſeruitude. And therefore there being no ſuch equitie in this vnhoneſt mariage; and ſeeing the Lord neuer by his ſole authoritie commandeth things vnlawfull and diſhoneſt, this example maketh nothing for their purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Againe, they obiect, that God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſacrifice his owne ſonne; which action in <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould haue been vnnaturall and wicked. I anſwere, that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement in Gods purpoſe, was a commandement of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all onely, which he meant not ſhould be put in execution. Yea, but though <hi>Abraham</hi> had ſlaine his ſonne, his action had been iuſt and lawfull. I anſwere that this alſo is moſt true; for ſeeing God, who is abſolute Lord of all creatures, and chiefe iudge of heauen and earth, hath vnlimited power of life and death: and ſeeing the party was to be ſlame, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he was innocent towards his father, yet had deſerued not onely temporarie, but alſo eternall death, in reſpect of his ſinnes againſt God; <hi>Abraham</hi> being commanded by God to be his miniſter of iuſtice in executing deſerued pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:10737:23"/> vpon his ſonne, was to ſet aſide fatherly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to yeeld obedience to Gods ſeruice, but yet iuſt commandement. Neuertheleſſe becauſe the outward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of this act would haue ſeemed vnnaturall and againſt the law of nature and nations, the Lord onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned it by way of triall, and neuer purpoſed that it ſhould be put in execution; although being the father of ſpirits, it was eaſie for him, to haue raiſed him againe from death to life. And therefore this ſemblable commandement of a ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnlawfull thing, affordeth no colour, to proue that this diſhoneſt marriage ſhould bee actually inioyned and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we may not giue ſuch an expoſition of one of Gods Commandements, which contradicteth and croſſeth an other: but that one of ſuch holy and high a calling as this Prophet, ſhould linke himſelfe in marriage with an infamous and common harlot, contradicteth and croſſeth other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; and therefore we are not thus to expound it. The propoſition needes no proofe: the aſſumption is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by theſe reaſons: In that it was vnlawfull for the high Prieſt to take to wife a diuorced woman, a woman polluted, or an harlot; nay, he might not ſo much as marry a widowe: Leuit. 21. 14. In that the Lord giueth ſpeciall charge, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 21. 14. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 6.</note> the choyce of his Miniſters; that <hi>their wiues be honeſt, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and faithfull:</hi> 1. Tim. 3. 11. and <hi>that they haue faithfull chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, not riotous or diſobedient.</hi> And therefore it is not likely that the Lord, who hath had ſuch ſpeciall care of their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, would inioyne his Prophet to take vnto him an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, and her adulterous broode; and ſo make his houſe, which ſhould be vndefiled, a ſtewes or filthy brothell.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by ſuch a marriage God ſhould haue made his Prophet contemptible, and his miniſtery; and that true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which he profeſſed, ſhould by this meanes haue beene deſpiſed, and expoſed to the ſlanderous reproach of vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, who are apt to take all occaſions, whereby they may diſgrace Gods Miniſters and their miniſtery.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, whereas the Lord calleth not onely his wife, a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:10737:24"/> woman of fornications, but his children alſo, children of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications: hereby it is manifeſt, that this was not actually done, but in viſion and parable: for if we ſay, that they were her children before marriage, the text is plaine againſt it, which affirmeth; that ſhe conceiued after marriage, and bare theſe children vnto him: if wee ſay, that the Prophet had them by her in lawfull marriage; how then could they bee truely called children of fornication, though before marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ſhe had plaied the harlot?</p>
               <p>Fiftly, there was no neceſſitie why this ſhould be actually done; ſeeing, if it onely appeared to the Prophet in viſion, and were deliuered to the people by way of parable, it were ſufficient to conuince them of their ſinne; which was the maine end the Lord aimed at.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, it ſhould not haue been ſo fit for Gods purpoſe, that this ſhould be actually done; ſeeing he could not marry her, and haue by her three children one after an other, in leſſe time then almoſt three yeares: whereas the Lord ſendeth his Prophet, to the end that hee ſhould preſently conuince the people of their ſinnes, and reclaime them from their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which were ſo great that they needed preſent cure.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, in the third chapter the Lord commandeth the Prophet to loue, and take vnto him an adulterous harlot: but this the Lord would not haue actually done; for the Lord is a holy and pure Spirit, who hateth and abhorreth adulterie, and all vncleanneſſe; but onely in type would haue the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of the Iſraelites, which they committed with their falſe gods, diſcouered: from which the great loue, which he their Lord and husband had from time to time ſhewed vnto them, could not reſtraine them. And therefore, ſeeing that is typically to be vnderſtood; why not this alſo?</p>
               <p>But it is obiected, that in the text, this is plainely ſet down as an hiſtory of things actually done. I anſwere, that this <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection </seg>1</label> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> is vſuall with the Prophets, to the end that they may, after a more ſignificant and emphaticall manner, expreſſe their mindes, and leaue a more deepe impreſſion in the mindes of their hearers, to propound types and parables as hiſtories of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:10737:24"/> things done, for the diſtinguiſhing whereof: and the true expounding of ſuch places we are to obſerue this rule, that where the litteral ſenſe implieth any impoſſibility, or groſſe abſurditie, or any thing contrarie to the analogie of faith, or ſome other plaine place of Scripture, there wee are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it as a type or parable: but in this place if wee take the litterall ſenſe, it implieth a groſſe abſurditie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicteth other places of Scripture, as I haue ſhewed, and therefore it is to be vnderſtood typically and as a parable.</p>
               <p>Neither are we to vnderſtand this place ſo only, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other the like which ſeeme as plaine hiſtories of things done, as this here. So <hi>Eſay</hi> is ſaid to haue walked naked and barefoote 3. yeeres, Eſa. 20. 2. 3. So <hi>Ezechiel</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <note place="margin">

All which and many ſuch like were not things done, but viſions and parables.</p>
               <p>But it is further obiected, that it ſhould bee to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection </seg>2</label> if this were not really done; and that it would haue been as effectuall to conuince the people of their ſinnes, if the Prophet had ſet them before them in plaine words, and vſed no parables. I anſwer, that parables are more emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> and leaue a more deepe impreſſion then bare words; for they are as it were reall ſpeeches, wherein things are liuely repreſented to the ſight of the vnderſtanding, as in pictures and tables. And therefore the Lord would haue his Prophet not onely in plaine words, but alſo in parables to ſet before the people their ſinnes, eſpecially their ſinne of idolatrie, wherein both their patents and themſelues had grieuouſly offended.</p>
               <p>As though he ſhould haue ſaid: The Lord inioyned me, to the end that I ſhould in more liuely manner ſet before you
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:10737:25"/> your ſinne of idolatrie, to propound vnto you this parable, wherein he commanded me, to reſemble himſelfe vnto me, who ſhould marrie a harlot, and haue by her adulterous children. For whereas the Lord like a louing husband had eſpouſed you vnto him, you haue plaied the harlot, and haue committed ſpirituall adulterie with idols and diuels, ſo that now the land is become like vnto a brothel or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtewes. And therefore the Lord is purpoſed to take with you that courſe which husbands do with their adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wiues, that is, to diuorce and put you away from him.</p>
               <p>And this is the generall meaning of this parable. Now let vs conſider the particular words. <hi>Goe take vnto thee a wife of fornications.</hi> That is, take in mariage a wife which is an infamous &amp; common harlot, which hath not only once, but often, not with one man alone, but with many commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fornication, and that not onely before mariage, but alſo after, and therefore not only an harlot, but an adultereſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, as appeareth, Chap. 3. 1. By wife then of fornications, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3. 1.</note> we are to vnderſtand a fornicating wife, or a wife which is a fornicatour; for the Hebrewes, by reaſon that they haue few adiectiues, do vſe the Genitiue caſes of ſubſtantiues, in ſtead of adiectiues, as, <hi>A woman of vertue,</hi> for a vertuous woman, Ruth 3. 11. <hi>A citie of ſtrength,</hi> for a ſtrong citie, Eſa. 26. 1. The which Genitiue caſe, if it be the plurall number, it doth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ruth</hi> 3. 11. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 26. 1.</note> aggrauate the thing, and is to be vnderſtood ſuperlatiuely, as, <hi>A man of bloods,</hi> that is, a moſt bloodie man, Pſal. 5. 6. <hi>A</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>man of griefes,</hi> that is, a man full of griefes, or extremely grieued: Eſa. 53. 3. So here, a <hi>wife of fornications,</hi> that is, a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53. 3.</note> harlot addicted to all manner of iuſt and vncleanneſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And children of fornications.</hi> That is, beget of this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane and filthie wife, vncleane and filthy children: which may be called children of fornications, either becauſe they are borne of an adulterous harlot; or becauſe when they come to yeeres, they will reſemble and imitate their mother in her fornications.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of the words. In which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded a parable to the Iſraelites, wherein the Prophet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:10737:25"/> the perſon of God; the wife of fornications, the Church or Synagogue of the Iſraelites, or the ten Tribes; the children of fornications, the particular men and women, which ſucceſſiuely one age after an other, committed ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall fornication, forſaking God, their firſt and true huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and betaking themſelues to the worſhippe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of idols.</p>
               <p>Where we may obſerue the great mercy and goodneſſe of God, who vouchſafeth to match himſelfe in marriage with his Church, which is farre vnworthy ſo great a fauour, and ſo excellent a dignity. Chriſt Ieſus hath eſpouſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto vs: but what were we before he made choyce of vs? <note place="margin">Gods mercy vouchſafed his Church in her eſpouſals.</note> ſurely vncleane <hi>fornicators,</hi> who had proſtituted our ſelues to idols, <hi>wantons, buggerers, theeues, couetous, drunkards, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, extortioners;</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 1. Cor. 6. 9, 10, 11. And what are we after our eſpouſals? ſurely blacke through <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 4.</note> our corruptions, ſpotted with manifold infirmities, tanned with the ſunſhine of wordly proſperity, and in no reſpect comely and beautifull, but onely in that we are decked and adorned with the glorious robe of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and waſhed from our filthineſſe with his precious blood. And that which is worſt of all, the gracious goodneſſe and entire loue of our husband, will not worke in vs the like loue towards him againe; but as before we were exalted by his free choice to this high dignity, we plaied the harlot: ſo, after that we are eſpouſed, we commit ſpirituall whoredome, by ſetting our hearts and affections, more vpon the world and the pleaſures thereof, then vpon our heauenly husband, for euery ſmall trifle proſtituting our ſoules to ſinne, which we ſhould keepe pure and vndefiled. And yet notwithſtanding all this the Lord doth not diuorce vs from him, but exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs to returne, promiſing that hee will receiue vs into his former loue and fauour. Ier. 3. 1. 12. 14, 22. <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>And ſo much concerning Gods Commandement. Now we are to ſpeake of the reaſon thereof. <hi>For the land hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted great whoredome, departing from the Lord.</hi> By <hi>land,</hi> we are to vnderſtand the inhabitants of the land, by a vſuall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonymie
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:10737:26"/> of the ſubiect for the adiunct: that is, the ten Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which in times paſt were married to the Lord, by promiſing vnto him alone, their faith and loyall obedience. <hi>Hath committed great whoredome.</hi> The Hebrew text hath it; <hi>Becauſe the land whoring ſhall whore.</hi> By which manner of phraſes, wherein the word is doubled, the thing ſpoken is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and aggrauated; as, <hi>weeping he wept:</hi> that is, he wept exceedingly: <hi>reioycing he reioyced:</hi> that is, he greatly reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: <hi>going he went:</hi> that is, he went haſtily and ſpeedily: ſo here; <hi>whoring it ſhall whore:</hi> that is, it will commonly, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, and with a braſen forehead play the harlot: and that without intermiſſion, ſucceſſiuely one age after an other; for ſo much is ſignified by the future tenſe here vſed: by which vſually is expreſſed a continuall act of time; as though hee would ſay, that the Iſraelites had not in former times onely, and preſently did, but afterwards would continue in their ſpirituall whoredome.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it is ſaid, that they committed this whoredome, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the Lord.</hi> The Hebrew text hath it; <hi>From after the Lord:</hi> that is, forſaking the Lord, and leauing to follow after him in the paths of true holineſſe and righteouſneſſe, and cleauing vnto their idols, following them in the by-paths of ſuperſtition and idolatry.</p>
               <p>The ſenſe therefore of theſe wordes is this; Goe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound vnto the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> this parable, and thereby conuince them of their groſſe idolatry: for howſoeuer they may flatter themſelues through ſelfe-loue, yet the trueth is, they are no better then common harlots; for after that I haue vouchſafed them this dignity, to eſpouſe them to my ſelfe, and they haue plighted vnto me their faith, and vowed their obedience, they both forgetfull of my mercie, and of their owne dutie, haue commonly, impudently, and continually committed ſpirituall whoredome with ſtockes, ſtones, and diuels, forſaking me their Lord and husband, and refuſing to follow me in the waies of my commandements, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting their bodies and ſoules to commit ſpirituall forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with their idols, according to their owne inuentions,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:10737:26"/> and their burning and vnbridled luſts and appetites.</p>
               <p>Where firſt we may obſerue, that the Lord intending to <note place="margin">The vſe of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his ſins.</note> conuince this people of their ſinnes, doth (before he plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſets downe their ſins) propound it vnto them by way of parable; to the end that they, who were blinded with ſelfe-loue and partiall Iudges in their owne caſes, might better ſee their ſinnes in the perſon of others, and without partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie condemne them, when they appeared like ſtrangers, which they would ſuffer to paſſe without any hard cenſure, if they diſcerned them to be of their familiar acquaintance. And thus <hi>Nathan</hi> dealt with <hi>Dauid:</hi> 2. Sam. 12. And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt with the Scribes and Phariſies: Matth. 21. 33. <note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 33.</note> And here in this place the Lord maketh the people to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne themſelues and their ſinnes, in the perſon and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of an adulterous harlot: and ſo inticeth them (as it were) to wound and kill their beloued friend, whileſt it is masked and diſguiſed in the habit of an enemy.</p>
               <p>Out of which we may further gather, how farre wee are naturally in loue with our ſinnes; ſo that we cannot be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <note place="margin">Our naturall and corrupt loue to ſinne.</note> to hate, condemne, and mortifie them, ſo long as they beare our owne names; but rather are ready to mince, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, and defend them, vntill we view them in the perſon of others, and ſee them enrolled vnder their names.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee may note our too too great loue of our ſelues, and too too ſmall loue towards our neighbours; <note place="margin">That ſelfe-loue makes vs exceeding partiall.</note> which maketh vs eaſily to diſcerne, and heauily and ſeuerely to cenſure other mens faults; whereas we are readie to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe or defend the ſame, or greater in our ſelues: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> Lord, when he would haue vs to ſee and condemne our ſinnes, doth not offer them to our cenſure, as they are in our owne ſelues, whom we loue too much; but in the perſon of others, whom for the moſt part, we loue not ſo much as we ſhould: as appeareth in the former examples, and in this place: wherein the Lord is faine to deale with vs, as tender mothers deale with their wanton and wayward children; whom when they would as willingly amend, as vnwillingly diſpleaſe them, they vſe to chide and beate the ſtanders by,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:10737:27"/> and ſometime ſhadowes and pictures, for thoſe faults which their children haue committed; to the end, that ſo they may ſee and learne to diſlike their faults in others, which they would not ſo eaſily diſcerne, nor ſo vnpartially condemne in themſelues.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we may obſerue, what exordium or beginning <note place="margin">The thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordium of the Prophet.</note> of ſpeech the Prophet here vſeth; namely, hee doth not vſe faire words, and ſweete inticing allurements to make them attentiue; hee doth not firſt ſweeten his ſeuere and bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, and legall threatnings, with any commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their perſons, or mitigation of their faults; but by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding vnto them this parable, whereby he laboureth to make them vnpartiall Iudges of their owne ſinfull and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable eſtate; he accuſeth them to be no better, then an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous generation, of adulterous parents, adulterous children, and that by their often adulteries they had made the land as it were a common ſtewes: and therefore that the Lord would no longer beare with their ſpirituall whoredomes, but would withdraw his loue, and diuorce them from him.</p>
               <p>So that now our Prophet commeth not as an Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour, ſent from God with conditions of peace, and with gracious promiſes, to allure them to obedience: but as a ſonne of thunder, and like an Herauld ſent from the Lord to denounce open warres againſt the people, for their groſſe idolatry and outragious rebellion, hee beginneth his ſpeech vnto them.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why the Lord cauſeth his Prophet thus thunderingly to beginne his prophecie, was, becauſe the <note place="margin">Why the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet dealeth ſo roughly with the people.</note> people had a long time, euen ſince the beginning of <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams</hi> raigne, continued in their ſinnes, eſpecially their groſſe idolatry: notwithſtanding that the Lord had ſent diuers of his Prophets, to reproue them for their ſinnes, of which their conſciences were conuinced by Gods law, and to draw them to repentance: ſometimes by propounding vnto them Gods ſweete promiſes of gratious benefits, if they would turne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; and ſometimes by threatning puniſhments againſt thoſe, who went forward in their ſinnes. All which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:10737:27"/> the people continued vncorrigible, and grew worſe and worſe; and therefore the Lord cauſeth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to deale with them in this hot and rough manner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had a long time lien froſen in the dregs of their ſinnes.</p>
               <p>And this courſe haue other of Gods faithfull ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours vſed, when they had to deale with ſuch obſtinate and incurable ſinners. As <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt with the Saduces and Phariſes, Matth. 3. 7. <hi>Peter</hi> with <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> Act. <note place="margin">

And our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe with the Prieſts and Phariſes: Matth. 21. &amp; 23.</p>
               <p>Out of which examples Gods Miniſters may learne, in the deliuerie of Gods word ſpirituall diſcretion, in fitting their ſpeech according to the condition of their auditorie; and not to deale with ignorant and vntaught men, after the ſame manner that they deale with wilfull and obſtinate ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; but as Phyſitions put a difference in their patients, applying to ordinarie ſickneſſes ordinarie remedies, and to deſperate diſeaſes, deſperate phyſicke, and as Chirurgions to ſmall cuts, applie healing plaiſters, and for the curing of deepe feſtered wounds vſe eating corroſiues and the ſharpe lancher: So the Phyſition and Surgion of the ſoule for the curing of ſome deſperate diſeaſe, or healing of ſome feſtered ſore which ſinne hath made in mens conſciences, muſt vſe bitter potions, a rough hand, and deſperate remedies.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God beginneth here with legall comminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <note place="margin">The beſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching for the conuerting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

For firſt their ſores and feſtered wounds muſt be lanched, ſearched and drawne with the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour and corroſiue of the law, before they be healed with the plaiſters of Gods promiſes in the Goſpell; for otherwiſe the wound being not healed to the bottom will breake out againe, and become worſe then it was. Firſt we muſt be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten downe, before we can be raiſed vp; we muſt firſt ſee our ſinnes, and ſeeing bewaile them, before God will ſhew vnto
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:10737:28"/> vs his ſauing mercie; wee muſt bee nothing in our ſelues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can be ſomething in Gods ſight; we muſt labour and grone vnder the heauie burthen of our ſinnes, deſiring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then to be eaſed of this intollerable waight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we will come to Chriſt, or he relieue vs; we muſt ſee our owne nakedneſſe, before hee will clothe vs with the robe of his righteouſneſſe; our owne emptineſſe, before he will fill vs; our owne beggerlineſſe, before hee will inrich vs; and our owne ſinnes before he will pardon vs. All which prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is begun by the preaching of the law, and therefore the Lord beginneth with it here, as alſo hee tooke the ſame courſe with our firſt parents, Gen. 3. and with his Church <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.</note> and people from time to time: ſo <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt himſelfe, whoſe example all his faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are to imitate, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The third thing which we are to obſerue, is, that he deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phereth <note place="margin">Why idolatry is called forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> the idolatrie of the people vnder the name of forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, whoredome, and adulterie; and that for diuers cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: firſt in that there is betweene them great ſimilitude and likeneſſe. For as the man taketh the woman to wife (coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall faith being on both ſides promiſed) ſo the Lord hath married vnto him the Church, and in Ieſus Chriſt, the ſecond perſon in Trinity, hath aſſumed mans nature into y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall vnion, and ſo hath inſeparablie ioyned vs vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, Ieſus Chriſt alſo being knit vnto vs in that myſtical vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo becomming our head and husband. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there is a mutuall contract paſſed betweene vs: for the Lord promiſeth his grace, loue, fauour, protection, and all the benefits of this life, and the life to come; and the Church for her part promiſeth her loue to God, coniugall faith, and dutifull obedience. And of this mariage mention is made, Hoſea 2. 19. 20. Ier. 3. 1. 8. 20. 2. Cor. 11. 2. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 19. 20. <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 1. 8. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>As therfore the wife breaking her coniugal faith and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and withdrawing her loue, obedience, and bodie from her husband, that ſhe may communicate them to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, becommeth an adultereſſe; ſo thoſe who breake their faith and couenant made with God, and withdraw their
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:10737:28"/> loue, obedience, and outward ſeruice from him, that they may communicate them vnto falſe gods and idols, doe go a whoring after them, and commit ſpirituall adulterie with them. And this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reaſon why in the Scriptures idolaters are vſually called harlots, fornicators, and adulterers, and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, whoredome and adulterie; as appeareth, Exod. 34. 15. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 15. <hi>Leuit.</hi> 20. 5. 6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 16. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 106. 39</note> 16. Leuit. 20. 5. 6. Deut. 31. 16. Pſalm. 106. 39.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as the adulterers are ſo blinded with their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning luſt, and blind furie, that though they bee naturally wiſe, yet they fall into ſottiſh folly, running headlong, and as it were blindfold in their vncleane and filthie courſes, though thereby they impaire their health, ruine their ſtate, loſe their credit, ſhorten their life, and deſtroy their owne ſoules: ſo Idolaters, though neuer ſo wiſe, through their blind ſuperſtition are ſo infatuated, that they beleeue more palpable lies and fall into more ſottiſh follies, then little children could be brought vnto; not regarding their health, wealth, life nor credit, and hazarding the loſſe of their ſoules, ſo that they may goe forward in their blind deuotion.</p>
               <p>The ſecond cauſe why idolatrie is called adulterie is, to ſhew the greatneſſe of this ſinne, and how odious it is in Gods ſight; for as it is a moſt horrible fault, and to any lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing husband moſt abominable, if a wife ſhould proſtitute her ſelfe vnto others, and that in her husbands ſight and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: ſo is this ſinne of idolatrie no leſſe grieuous or odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, becauſe the Idolaters doe proſtitue themſelues to idols, to commit ſpirituall whoredome with them, and that in the ſight and preſence of God, who ſeeth all things and is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent euery where.</p>
               <p>But it may be obiected, that idolatrie is a farre greater ſinne then adulterie, and therefore when it is called by that name, the ſin is rather extenuated then aggrauated. I anſwer, firſt the grieuouſneſſe of this ſinne is ſo much the greater, by how much more excellent the perſon is who is iniured and offended; and therefore when this adulterie is committed againſt Gods glorious Maieſtie, it is infinitely more outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and hainous then when man is thus wronged.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:10737:29"/>
               <p> Secondly, though idolatrie is a farre greater ſinne then adulterie, yet when it is called by this name it is aggrauated, not in it own nature, but according to mens conceit and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; who make light account of the ſins of the firſt table, as idolatrie, blaſphemie, breaking the Sabbath, but thinke the ſinnes of the ſecond table very hainous in reſpect of the other, as murther adulterie, theft and ſuch like. And therfore the Lord calleth them by the names of theſe ſinnes, which we can better iudge of, to make them as they are odious and hainous in their owne nature, ſo alſo to appeare vnto vs. As if a man hauing to deale with a louing child, and intending to aggrauate the hainouſneſſe of this ſinne of murthering the prince, ſhould compare it to parricide, he ſhould to his conceit make it appeare much more grieuous, although it be a farre more hainous and pernitious ſinne to murther the prince, who is the father of the countrie, then a mans owne naturall parent.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the things which are to be obſerued out of <note place="margin">Idolatrie and ſuperſtition know no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits.</note> the name. The fourth thing to be obſerued, is, that hee ſaith, they had committed great whoredoms, and alſo continued in them: wherein we may note the nature as of all other ſins, ſo of this ſin of idolatrie. For if once it bee entertained, it knoweth no limits nor bounds; but with the heate of blind furie, &amp; ignorant ſuperſtition, it carrieth me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as it were hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winckt into all groſſe and abominable impietie: ſo that there is no creature in heauen or earth ſo baſe and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, which the Idolater in his blind deuotion wil not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the place of God, as appeareth, Rom. 1. 23. And this <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 23.</note> befalleth them by the iuſt iudgement of God, that they ſhould be carried away in their ſottiſh blindneſſe into ſuch groſſe abſurdities, and more then childiſh fooleries, becauſe when God reuealeth his trueth vnto them, they will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and loue it, but rather loue their owne will-worſhip <note place="margin">1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 11. The neerer man draweth to idols, the farther he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from God.</note> and follow the inuentions of their owne braine, 1. Theſ. 2. 11.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we may obſerue, that he ſaith, whilſt they commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſpirituall whoredoms, they departed from the Lord; ſo that the neerer man draweth vnto idols, the further hee
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:10737:29"/> goeth from God, neither is it poſſible that any ſhould truely worſhip both together; as the Apoſtle ſheweth, 1. Cor. 10. 21. 2. Cor. 6. 14. 16. The Idolaters pretend, that when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit idolatry, they worſhip God in the idoll. But the Lord affirmeth, that then they depart from him. They ſay, that they ſerue God when they vſe their owne wil-worſhip, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their owne waie. But the Lord, who acknowledgeth no worſhippe, but when we followe him in the waies of his Commandements, ſaith; that when wee walke in our owne waies, we goe out of his way, and ceaſe to follow him; wee forſake him who is our true husband, and after a whoriſh manner proſtitute our ſelues vnto idols.</p>
               <p>Where by the way we may note the ſottiſh folly of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, <note place="margin">The folly of Idalaters.</note> who leaue the Lord, infinite in all perfections, and worſhip a baſe creature; forſake the Lord, who is moſt wiſe, mighty, gracious, and in euery reſpect abſolutely good, and betake themſelues to the worſhip often times of ſtockes and ſtones, who haue neither vnderſtanding, ſenſe, life, nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; neglect Gods ſeruice, who hath both power and will to reward their ſeruice with eternall life; and ſpend their time in the ſeruice of idols, who haue neither ability, nor will to doe them any good, but rather will be the meanes to plunge them into euerlaſting deſtruction.</p>

               <p>It may be, that the firſt word <hi>Gomer,</hi> might be the name of ſome notorious and infamous harlot which liued in thoſe times: and it may be alſo, that it was onely a fained and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:10737:30"/> name, inuented of purpoſe to decipher ſuch a one as the Prophet here deſcribeth: for it ſignifieth a thing whole and intire or conſummate, complete, perfect, and accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.

               <p>Firſt, we may obſerue the infinite mercy of God towards <note place="margin">Gods mercy towards his people.</note> this people; who though they were fully repleniſhed with all ſinne and wickedneſſe, though like filthy harlots they had forſaken him, their true and moſt kinde husband, and giuen themſelues to commit ſpiritual whoredome with their idols; and though they were complete and conſummate in this their adultery; yet ſtill hee calleth them vnto him againe by his Prophets, promiſing vpon their true repentance, mercy and forgiueneſſe: ſo Ier. 3. 1. <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Deus fortis,</hi> the ſtrong God. In the firſt ſignification, the Iſraelites did arrogate this name to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:10737:31"/> and therefore called their metropolis and mother ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their kingdom by the name of Izreel. To note and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that they thought themſelues the ſeede of God, which he hauing ſowed had ſo deepely taken roote, that it could neuer bee remooued, the vineyard of God which is right hand had planted, and ſhould neuer be deſtroyed, the ſonnes and children of God, which were the only heires of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. And indeede ſo they were in reſpect of the couenant which was betweene God and them, and therefore are ſo called in the Scriptures, Exod. 4. 22. <hi>Iſrael is my ſonne, euen</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>my firſt borne.</hi> But they hauing broken the couenant, and rebelled againſt the Lord; he doth not in this ſignification call the child <hi>Iizrehel;</hi> but in the latter, to ſhew vnto them that they ſhould be ſuch, as the Lord would ſcatter and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe amongſt their enemies.</p>
               <p>And this is the ſignification of this name, whereby theſe three things are intimated and ſhewed: firſt in an elegant paranomaſie, he changeth their name from <hi>Iſrael</hi> to <hi>Iizre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hel,</hi> to intimate that there was a change of their ſtate and condition, ſo that howſoeuer they bragged that they were of the ſeede and poſteritie of <hi>Iacob,</hi> and after his name called themſelues Iſraelites, yet in truth they were ſo only in title and outward profeſſion, ſeeing they were wholly degenerate and altogether vnworthy his name. For he was a prince of the ſtrong God, who wraſtling with God in faith, prayers, and ſtrong cries preuailed with him; but theſe were apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taes from the faith, who had forſaken the Lord, and ceaſed <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 12. 4.</note> to call vpon him, and had betaken themſelues to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of idols: and therefore they were rather to bee called Iizraelites, to ſhew, that as they were altered in name, ſo alſo in nature and conditions they were vtterly degenerate. And that as betweene theſe two names <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Iizrehel,</hi> there is great ſimilitude in ſound, but great difference in ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification; ſo although in outward title, name and profeſſion, there was great affinity betweene this people, and the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch <hi>Iacob,</hi> from whom they deſcended, yet they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede and truth ſo much degenerate, that there was no ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:10737:32"/> or correſpondence betweene their faith, life and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by this name the Lord foreſheweth the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment that he would inflict vpon them for their ſinnes, namely that he would diſperſe and ſcatter them amongſt their enemies. They boaſted that they were <hi>Iiſrahel</hi> the ſeede of God, which ſhould take roote in the land. And the Lord telleth them that indeede they ſhould be <hi>Iizrahel,</hi> but in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother ſignification; namely, that as ſeed is ſcattered and diſperſed in the field by the hand of the ſower, ſo he by his power would ſcatter and diſperſe them amongſt their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who ſhould ouercome them, and leade them away captiue into ſtrange countries.</p>
               <p>The which accordingly was effected in three ſeuerall times, anſwerable to this triple typicall birth.

And therefore the paine ſhould make the pleaſure loathſome, the bitterneſſe of puniſhment ſhould make vs diſtaſte the ſweetneſſe of ſinne.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:10737:32"/>
               <p> The ſecond thing which wee may here obſerue is, how <note place="margin">2. Our prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to ſinne.</note> prone we are vnto ſin, and how eaſily wee degenerate from our parents vertues, though their corruptions and ſinnes are entailed vnto vs as a perpetuall inheritance; of true Iſraelites, we become backſliding <hi>Iizreelites;</hi> and though by the good example of our parents, by our vertuous education, and by many other good meanes, we are helped forward, in climing vp the hill of vertue; yet if we at any time ceaſe to ſtriue and labour in this our courſe, we ſhall ſoone bee preſſed downe againe, euen into the gulfe of wickedneſſe, with the heauy burthen of our corruptions. And therefore, <hi>Let vs caſt away euery thing that preſſeth downe, and the ſinne that hangeth ſo faſt on, and let vs runne with patience the race which is ſet before vs:</hi> as the Apoſtle exhorteth, Heb. 12. 1. and according to <note place="margin">

               <p>The time is ſignified in theſe words, <hi>yet a little,</hi> whereby he intimateth two things; firſt, that the Lord would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently inflict theſe iudgements threatned; but that he would yet giue them ſome time of repentance, and for a while de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre his puniſhments, which long agoe they had deſerued. 2. That though hee ſpared them for a while, yet the time ſhould not be long, vnleſſe they preuented his iudgements by forſaking their ſinnes, and turning vnto him. For in all threatnings, though neuer ſo ſpeedie, this condition is to be obſerued: the which the Iſraelites neglecting, the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was accordingly inflicted. For at the moſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet propheſied but 14. yeeres before the end of <hi>Ieroboams</hi> raigne, and after that his ſonne <hi>Zacharias</hi> had reigned but

It is true indeede, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though your outragious wickedneſſe doth crie out for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vengeance, yet the Lord to ſhew his patience and long ſuffering, and to leaue you quite without excuſe, will a little deferre his puniſhments, and expect your repentance: but let not Gods delaies and mercifull patience cauſe you to deferre your conuerſion; for vndoubtedly if you obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſiſt in your impenitencie, the Lord will very quickly execute on you theſe iudgements, which he hath cauſed mee to denounce againſt you.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of theſe words, <hi>yet a little.</hi> The <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The doctrines. </seg>
                  </label> doctrines which hence we gather are theſe. Firſt we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue <note place="margin">1. Gods pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and long ſuffering.</note> Gods infinite mercy, patience &amp; long ſuffering, in ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of this rebellious people, long after their ſins cried for vengeance, in the meane time ſending his Prophets vnto them, to inuite the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to repentance, that ſo they might eſcape his iuſt puniſhments. He is long before he threatneth, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtriueth to maſter mens ſtubburnnes, &amp; to incline them to obedience, by his mercies and benefits; and after he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, he is long before he is drawne to puniſh; and after that his iuſtice vrgeth him to reſolue vpon this, and that the hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſinnes of his people crie out in his cares, that it is more then time that deſerued puniſhment were inflicted, yet hee ſpareth a little, and like a louing father, after he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath taken
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:10737:34"/> his rod into his hand, and hath lifted it vp to fetch his ſtroke, he yet pauſeth and ſtaieth his hand, expecting our ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and repentance, that ſo hee may ſpare vs. And thus hee dealt with the old world, as appeareth, Gen. 6. 5. 12. 13. with <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5. 12 13.</note> the Amorits, who though they were moſt wicked idolaters, yet he deferred their puniſhment 400. yeeres, Gen. 15. 16. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 16.</note> And thus alſo hath the Lord dealt with vs. So that the Lord is content to attend our leaſure, being more loath to puniſh, then we to ſuffer puniſhment; and therefore when the time is more then paſt, wherein iuſtice b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ggeth for vengeance; mercie intreateth yet a little, that iudgement may be defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yea and after ſentence is pronounced, that execution may be delaied, and we reprieued, till the next aſſiſes, that in the meane time by true repentance, we may procure our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and ſo eſcape deſerued puniſhment. And this is nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie ſet downe, Eſa. 30. 18. <hi>Yet therefore will the Lord waite</hi>

                  <hi>that he may haue mercie vpon you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we may obſerue Gods infallible truth, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming <note place="margin">2 Gods infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble truth in performing his promiſes.</note> his promiſes, notwithſtanding mans vnworthines of the leaſt of them. After that <hi>Iehu</hi> had executed Gods iudgements vpon the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> the Lord promiſed him that he would confirme the kingdome vnto him, and his poſterity vnto the fourth generation. Now after this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made by God, <hi>Iehu</hi> who had ſhewed his hatred to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabs</hi> perſon and poſterity, ſhewed notwithſtanding his loue to his ſinnes, forſaking the Lord and betaking himſelfe to the worſhip of idols. And in his ſteps did his progenie walke, adding one outragious wickedneſſe to another: but yet neuer the leſſe the Lord made good his promiſes to him and his poſteritie. The conſideration whereof may comfort thoſe that are caſt downe in the ſight of their vnworthineſſe, thinking that becauſe they deſerue not Gods mercie, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhall not be partakers of it; ſeeing we haue his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious promiſes of grace and mercie, the which though there be no cauſe in vs, why he ſhould performe, yet there is cauſe enough in God himſelfe, who is infinite in mercy, and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in his truth. Rom. 3. 3, 4. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 3. 4.</note>

               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:10737:34"/>
               <p> Thirdly, we may obſerue that this people at this time, <note place="margin">3. Pride goeth before a fall.</note> when as the Prophet threatneth Gods neere approaching iudgements, were in the top of their pride preſumptuous and ſecure, fearing nothing leſſe then ſuch dangers; and yet at this time deſtruction haſted, and vengeance watched at the doore to ſeiſe vpon them. Whereby it appeareth, that when the wicked is moſt proud, preſumptuous, and ſecure, he is neereſt to deſtruction; when he thinketh himſelfe out <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 37. 35. 36.</note> of the gunſhot of all danger, then is hee moſt ready to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertaken of it; as appeareth by the examples of <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzer, Haman, Herod,</hi> and many others.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we may obſerue, that though the Lord ſpareth for <note place="margin">4. Puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts deferred, are in the end inflicted.</note> a time, yet he will not for euer deferre puniſhment: for as ſinne increaſeth, iudgement approcheth; and though the Lord long delay to viſit mens wickedneſſe, yet the time run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth on and expireth, and that which remaineth in the end, will be very ſhort and little before vengeance be inflicted. And therefore let not Gods patience and long ſuffering harden vs in ſinne, and cauſe vs to deferre; but rather haſten our repentance: let vs lay hold of the acceptable time and day of ſaluation, whileſt it laſteth; otherwiſe, if we delay our conuerſion, the Lord within a little while, when we leaſt looke for it, will cauſe his iudgements ſuddainly to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe vs.</p>
               <p>And thus much concerning the time: the puniſhment it ſelfe is expreſſed in theſe words; <hi>I will viſit.</hi> The which word <note place="margin">The Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</note> is of ambiguous ſignification: for it is ſometime taken in the beſt part, when as the Lord viſiteth in mercy, to beſtow a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite which hath been promiſed, but ſomewhile deferred. So he is ſaid to haue viſited <hi>Sara:</hi> Gen. 21. 1. And ſo he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to viſit the children of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> Exod. 13. 19. And Luk. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 21. 1. <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 19. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 68.</note> 1. 68. God is ſaid to <hi>haue viſited and redeemed his people.</hi> Sometimes it is taken in the worſt part, and ſignifieth to reuenge and puniſh; as in the ſecond Commandement. So Exo. 32. 34. <hi>In the day of my vengeance I will viſit their ſin vpon</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 34. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 89. 32.</note>

               <p> The doctrines which from hence we learne are theſe. Firſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The Do∣ctrines. </seg>
                  </label> we may obſerue the mercifull iuſtice of God, who doth not raſhly puniſh, but firſt viſiteth; and then finding the fault, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicteth <note place="margin">1. Gods merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full iuſtice, who exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth before he puniſh. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 20, 21. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 26. 14.</note> the puniſhment: in which reſpect his puniſhments are called viſitations. And thus the Lord viſited the Sdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites: Gen. 18. 20, 21. And ſo he is ſaid, firſt to haue viſited, and then to haue ſcattered and deſtroyed the wicked: Eſa. 26. 14. Whence we are not to gather, that the Lord needeth any ſuch viſitation to finde out mans wickedneſſe, or that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can ſpy out our ſinnes, he muſt make a queſt of inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, or priuy ſearch; for he is omnipreſent and omniſcient; ſo that all things, though neuer ſo much cloaked and diſguiſed, lye open before him, and appeare naked in his ſight: as it is Heb. 4. 13. But by ſuch borrowed phraſes God ſetteth forth his orderly proceedings, and approueth vnto men his iuſt <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 13.</note> iudgements, in that they are not raſhly executed, but with good aduice and deliberation; teaching them alſo in his own example to follow the like practiſe.</p>
               <p>Here therefore Princes, Magiſtrates, Maſters of families, and all ſuperiours are to learne their leſſon; namely, that <note place="margin">Superiours muſt viſit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh.</note> they viſit before they puniſh, and by due examination finde out the fault, before they giue ſentence, or proceede to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution: for if God thus behaue himſelfe in iudgement, before whoſe eyes all things lie open; how much more ſhould men, who are oft miſtaken, and eaſily deceiued, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they vſe great deliberation in their iudiciall procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings? Let therefore all ſuch conſider, that where there is the moſt power, there ſhould be the leaſt paſſion; that raſhneſſe is a fault, in all dangerous, but in ſuperiours pernicious: that reaſonable men ſhould firſt iudge before they puniſh, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe puniſhment deferred, may be inflicted, but being infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be recalled; that they ſuſtain the honorable place of a Iudge, whileſt they examine cauſes; but the place of an executioner, when without iudgement &amp; aduice they inflict puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: that they are Gods deputies, &amp; repreſent his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; &amp; therfore are according to his example, firſt to viſit, and then to puniſh, leſt for want of due examination, they puniſh
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:10737:35"/> the innocent in ſtead of offenders.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing which hence we learne is, that though God doth not raſhly puniſh, yet he will not ſuffer the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked altogether to eſcape: for though the Lord doth not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh euery day, yet in the day of his viſitation he will not ſpare. And therefore let vs keepe our ſelues vndefiled from ſinne: or if we haue ſtained our conſciences with ſinne, and haue as it were in theſe bookes regiſtred vp our faults; let vs by a liuely faith apply vnto vs the blood of Chriſt, whereby theſe ſpots and writings may be waſhed away: for if they remaine vntill the day of Gods viſitation, they will giue in ſuch witneſſe and euidence againſt vs, as will conuict and condemne vs.</p>
               <p>In the third place is ſet downe the ſinne for which the Lord <note place="margin">The expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</note> threatneth to viſit, in theſe words: <hi>The blood of Iizreel.</hi> The which words of diuers men, are diuerſly expounded: but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to ſet downe all mens iudgements, becauſe many of them haue little likelihood of trueth, I will onely propound two which ſeeme moſt probable. Some thinke that by the blood of <hi>Iiſreel,</hi> is vnderſtood the ſlaughter of <hi>Achabs</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie and poſterity, <hi>Ieſabel, Ioram,</hi> and his ſeuenty ſonnes, which were all deſtroyed by <hi>Iehu.</hi> Others imagine this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the meaning of the words; becauſe this was an action commanded by God: 2. King. 9 6, 7, 8. and commended in <hi>Iehu,</hi> after it was by him performed, and by God rewarded: 2. King. 10. 30. and done by <hi>Iehu</hi> in zeale of Gods glory, as he profeſſeth, 2.

And therefore they rather <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 9 6, 7. 2. <hi>King.</hi> 10. 30. 2. <hi>King.</hi> 10. 16.</note> thinke, that by <hi>Iiſreel</hi> here is vnderſtood, not the Citie or val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of <hi>Iiſreel,</hi> but the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which by <hi>Iehu</hi> and his poſteritie, were continued in their groſſe idolatrie, and ſo made obnoxious to the iudgements of God and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. And this expoſition doth the rather pleaſe them: Firſt, becauſe the name <hi>Iiſreel</hi> ſignifieth the ſeede of God, and therefore may be taken for the people of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſreel:</hi> as appeareth, Exodus chap. 4. verſe 22.

Yea, but will ſome ſay, this fact of <hi>Iehues</hi> was commanded of God to be done, and commended and rewarded when it was done; and therefore it is not likely that God would pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him and his poſteritie for it. I anſwer, that we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in this fact two things: the outward fact it ſelfe, and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hues</hi> doing of it. The outward fact it ſelfe was good, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:10737:36"/> by God himſelfe, as a iuſt reuenge taken vpon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab</hi> for his tyranny, murther, idolatry, and other outrages by him committed: and in reſpect hereof <hi>Iehu</hi> is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and rewarded; becauſe he was Gods miniſter and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in performing a worke in it ſelfe commendable and acceptable vnto God. But in reſpect of <hi>Iehu</hi> his doing of it, it was wicked and vnlawfull: for he did it not in the ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and vprightneſſe of his heart, but with a corrupt minde, poiſoned with ambition: as appeareth, 2. King. 10. 31. He did <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 10. 31.</note> it not in zeale of Gods glory, as he falſely boaſted; but his maine end was his owne aduancement; which when he had attained vnto, hee vtterly neglected the glory of God, and grieuouſly diſhonoured him by his groſſe Idolatry. He did not doe it in obedience to Gods commandement; for then he would haue made conſcience of the reſt, which hee tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed, reſting and contenting himſelfe like an hypocrite in this one outward act: he did not doe it in deteſtation of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabs</hi> ſinne, but for ſelfe-loue, for hee continued in the ſame idolatry: and although he deſtroyed <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts and houſe, yet following <hi>Ieroboams</hi> policie, hee worſhipped the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den calues in Dan and Bethel: whereby he cleerely ſhewed, that al he did was not in hatred of idolatry, but for his world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aduantage. He did not when he was ſeated in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, labour to reſtore Gods pure worſhip and ſeruice, for which end and purpoſe he was ſtirred vp of God to deſtroy <hi>Achabs</hi> poſterity; but hauing ſatisfied his ambitious deſire, he laboured to confirme the kingdome to himſelfe and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, by following <hi>Ieroboams</hi> policie, and liuing in his Idolatry, withholding his people from going to worſhippe the Lord in his Temple at Ieruſalem, which was the place appointed by God for his publike ſeruice, leſt they ſhould againe adioyne themſelues to the houſe of <hi>Dauid.</hi> So that hee onely made ſhew of religion and zeale, whileſt it ſtood with his owne worldly benefit; but when it but ſeemed to croſſe that, he ſhooke handes with all, and became an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. Howſoeuer therefore the fact, as it was commanded by God, was good and lawfull, and in reſpect hereof was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:10737:37"/> of God, who will not let any ſhew of good goe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recompenced, that hee may not onely heereby ſtop the mouthes of the wicked, but alſo giue certaine aſſurance vnto his children, that he will much more reward their true and ſincere obedience: yet if we reſpect with what mind and purpoſe it was performed by <hi>Iehu,,</hi> it was nothing but ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious rebellion, and cruell murther: which therefore at the hands of God (who reſpecteth not ſo much the outward action, as the ſincerity of the heart, the inward obedience of his commandement, the cauſes and ends of our actions) it was ſharpely and iuſtly puniſhed.</p>
               <p>The doctrines which from hence we learne are theſe. Firſt, that wee doe not content our ſelues with outward workes, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrines. </seg>
                  </label> good in their owne nature, and inioyned by God: for vnleſſe ther <note place="margin">What is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to the doing of a good worke.</note> circumſtances doe concurre, they will be wicked and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious in Gods ſight. Firſt therefore being aſſured that we do that which God hath commanded, let vs doe it in the loue of God, which is the fountaine of euery good worke, and in obedience to Gods commandement. Secondly, let vs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, as the maine ends of our actions, the glory of God, the good of his Church, and our owne ſaluation. Thirdly, let our outward obedience proceede from the inward obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the heart, and be done in ſincerity and in vprightnes. Fourthly, let all be done in faith; which by applying Chriſt and his pretious bloodſhed vnto vs, doth waſh away the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and imperfections wherewith our beſt actions are ſtained. For though our actions in themſelues be neuer ſo good; yet if they be done in ſelfe-loue, for our owne praiſe, pleaſure, and profit, without the ſinceritie of the heart, or true faith, they are but glorious ſinnes which diſpleaſe God, and make vs obnoxious to his iudgements and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are here admoniſhed, that we doe not with <hi>Iehu</hi> and other hypocrites, reſt and content our ſelues in <note place="margin">We muſt obey all Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> ſome one or two outward workes, neglecting obedience vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the reſt of Gods Commandements: aſſuring our ſelues, that if our obedience be true and ſincere, it will be alſo whole
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:10737:37"/> and intire, both in reſpect of the ſubiect and obiect, that is, both in reſpect of euery part of our ſelues who obey, and in reſpect of al and euery of Gods commandements, to which we are to yeeld obedience; for true ſanctification is not of one part alone, but of the whole man, and it maketh vs to hate all ſinnes, and to loue all vertues with the like affection, although not in the ſame proportion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we here learne, not to make our religion, and the <note place="margin">We muſt not make religion a cloake to couer our ſins.</note> commandements of almightie God a cloak for our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to couer our ambition, malice, cruelty, moroſity and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vices, as <hi>Iehu</hi> did. For if we do for corrupt and worldly ends imbrace and obey the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then when they wil not further, but rather hinder vs in theſe reſpects, we will caſt them off, and imbrace the contrarie ſinnes and wickedneſſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the example of <hi>Iehu,,</hi> and all other apoſtates, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth daily by too too lamentable experience. And ſo much for the ſin of <hi>Iehu</hi> and his poſteritie. The fourth thing is the ſubiect or obiect of the puniſhment, which is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; firſt the houſe of <hi>Iehu,</hi> by which is meant <hi>Iehu</hi> his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie, which was deſtroyed by <hi>Shallum,</hi> and ſo the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome taken from them; namely <hi>Zachariah,</hi> who was the laſt king of this family, and the fourth from <hi>Iehu.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here it may be demanded, how it could ſtand with Gods <note place="margin">How the child beareth the fathers ſinnes. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. 20.</note> iuſtice to puniſh <hi>Iehues</hi> ſinne in his poſteritie, ſeeing he ſaith that the child ſhall not beare his fathers iniquitie? Ezech. 18. 20. I anſwere, that the Lord may iuſtly puniſh the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſinne in the child, by withholding his grace from him, which he is not bound to giue him: and ſo the child being deſtitute hereof, and following his owne natural corruptions liueth in his fathers ſin and tranſgreſſions, and hereby iuſtly maketh himſelfe obnoxious to Gods anger &amp; puniſhment. It is true that the child is neuer puniſhed with any poſitiue puniſhment for his fathers faults, but for his owne ſinnes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which being depriued of Gods grace he falleth; <hi>For if he ſeeth his father ſinnes, and feareth, and forſaketh them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoureth to doe the contrarie workes of righteouſneſſe, his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſinnes ſhall not be imputed vnto him, but he ſhall liue in his</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:10737:38"/> 
                  <hi>owne righteouſneſſe,</hi> as appeareth, Ezech. 18. 14. which by Gods <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18. 14.</note> infinite and vnlimited mercie oftentimes commeth to paſſe.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof, firſt concerneth parents, that they be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note place="margin">Admonition to parents.</note> mooued to flee ſin, if not for their owne ſake, yet at leaſt for their poſterie, ſeeing the child vnborne ſhall ſmart for their iniquities, if the Lord, as hee iuſtly may, withhold his grace from them, and ſuffer them to be carried away with their corruptions; the which he often doth, as he alſo threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in the ſecond commandement.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the children of wicked parents may here learne <note place="margin">Admonition to children of wicked pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</note> carefully to flee their fathers vices, and to indeuour to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme holy obedience vnto the Lord, that ſo they may bee reconciled vnto him: for if they follow their fathers ſteppes, the Lord will certainely puniſh in them, not only their own, but alſo their parents ſinne, in the day of his viſitation.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing which here wee are to obſerue is, that God threatneth to begin his viſitation with the King and <note place="margin">God ſeuerely puniſheth the ſinnes of princes.</note> his poſteritie, becauſe their owne ſinnes were great and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, and alſo becauſe they were acceſſarie to the ſinnes of the people; for whereas by their authoritie and good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they might haue reſtrained them from their open ſinnes, and ſtirred them vp to the profeſſion and practiſe of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and holineſſe, they contrariwiſe both by their law licenſing idolatrie, and by their practiſe liuing in it, drew the people to follow their example: and therefore the Lord firſt beginneth to puniſh them, becauſe they were the firſt agents and moouers vnto ſinne.</p>
               <p>So that here we may learne, that it is not the great glorie and power of Princes, which wil exempt them from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when God viſiteth. For howſoeuer they are gods <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82 6. 7.</note> with men, yet they are but men with God, and as they ſhall die like men, ſo ſhall they be puniſhed like men, neither ſhal their great authoritie and high place any thing priuiledge them. Nay, they aboue and before all others ſhall ſurely ſmart for it, ſeeing they are ſeldome wicked alone, but with their authoritie and example draw others into the like wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:10737:38"/>
               <p> The vſe hereof concerneth not only Princes, but alſo Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and maſters of families, yea, al that are in any place of authoritie ouer others, that they moſt carefully auoide all ſinnes; eſpecially ſuch as are ioyned with ſcandall of their inferiours, ſeeing againſt the day of Gods viſitation they haſten and redouble their puniſhment.</p>
               <p>The ſecond obiect of this puniſhment is the ſtate and <note place="margin">Expoſition.</note> kingdome, in theſe words: <hi>And will cauſe to ceaſe the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the houſe of Iſrael.</hi> The which puniſhment the Lord begun to execute preſently after the ouerthrow of <hi>Iehues</hi> poſteritie, when as there were no lawful kings which gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Commonwealth, but ſuch as vſurped the kingdome by treaſon, murthers, &amp; al outragious cruelty: but it was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie accompliſhed 41. yeeres after the death of <hi>Zachariah,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reigne of <hi>Hoſhea,</hi> when as all Iſrael were carried away captiue, and neuer more had any kings of their owne to rule ouer them.</p>
               <p>Where firſt wee are to obſerue, what a ſingular bleſſing <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                  </label> of God it is, when there is a continued ſuceſſion of lawfull <note place="margin">Succeſſion of lawfull Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, is a great bleſſing to a land.</note> Princes; for it is the ſinewes of a State wherein conſiſteth her chiefe ſtrength, which, being cut off, either by death, or conſpiracies, treaſons and ſeditions, the ſtate and kingdome is miſerably turmoiled with ciuill warres, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, murthers, and maſſacres; wherewith being weakned, it is laid open as a prey to the forraigne enemie: as it nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly appeareth in this preſent example of <hi>Iehu,</hi> and his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours. The like whereof, this land hath had experience of, in the time of thoſe ciuill diſſcenſions betweene Yorke and Lancaſter. Whereby it further appeareth, that it is farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a State to be gouerned by a ſucceſſion of Princes, which are not of the beſt ſort, then that there ſhould be an anarchy, which is accompanied with ciuill warres, tumults, murthers, and innumerable miſchiefes; ſeeing the moſt ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall gouernment doth not ſubiect a State to ſuch and ſo great euils. <hi>Iehu</hi> and his poſterity were wicked and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Princes, but whileſt the ſucceſſion was continued in his houſe, the Common-wealth in ſome ſort flouriſhed: but

And therefore a wiſe people, after the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion is eſtabliſhed, will indure many iniuries, oppreſſions, and inſolencies at their Princes hands, rather then they will by treaſon and rebellion ſeeke their ouerthrow, ſeeing the deſtruction of the Prince is vſually accompanied with the ruine of the kingdome.</p>
               <p>The vſe which we are to make hereof is this, that with thankfull hearts, and bended knees, we praiſe the Lord; who when we were in danger of all theſe miſeries, hath eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed the kingdome, by giuing vnto vs a religious Prince, who hath confirmed our peace, and continued the Goſpell vnto vs, and hath not onely giuen vs aſſurance of theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits for his owne time; but alſo (by Gods bleſſing) ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to promiſe the continuance hereof, by the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſucceſſion in his royall poſteritie.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>The third obiect of puniſhment is the whole Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and people of Iſrael in theſe words, v. 5. <hi>And at that day I wil breake the bow of Iſrael in the vally of Iizreel.</hi> The meaning wherof is this. By <hi>that day,</hi> we are to vnderſtad, the <note place="margin">The expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</note> day of Gods viſitation, when as the meaſure of the peoples ſinne being full, and come to ripenes, hee would not onely ouerthrow <hi>Iehues</hi> poſteritie, and the ſtate of the kingdome, but alſo bring the like deſtruction vpon the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth and bodie of the people.</p>
               <p>By <hi>breaking of the bow,</hi> we are to vnderſtand the defeating and ſubuerting of their whole power, by a vſuall ſynecdoch of the part for the whole: ſo Pſalm. 44. 6. <hi>I trust not in my</hi>

               <p>From whence we learne, firſt, that although Princes and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrines. </seg>
                  </label> ſuperiours ſhall be moſt ſeuerely puniſhed, becauſe they
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:10737:39"/> haue not onely ſinned themſelues, but alſo by their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <note place="margin">The ſubiect is not acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted when his Prince lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him into ſinne.</note> and example haue drawne and allured their inferiours into like wickednes: yet the ſubiects who haue obeyed their lawfull authority in vnlawful things, and haue followed their example in euill, ſhall not be excuſed; but as they haue been partakers with them in their ſinnes, ſo likewiſe they ſhall be partakers with them in their puniſhments. For if authority be an argument to preuaile with them, then the authority of God, which is ſupreme, ſhould be of greater force to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue them in holy obedience, then the authority of man to draw them to ſinne: if examples doe ſtrongly allure and perſwade, then the example of God himſelfe, and of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, ſhould more forcibly reſtraine vs from ſinne, then of the greateſt Prince in the world to intice vs to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is, that we be not forced with any humane authority to fall into ſinne: for when they haue done their worſt, they can but kill the body; and bleſſed are they who chuſe rather to giue their liues &amp; deareſt blood, then to pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute their conſciences with knowne wickedneſſe: for by ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againſt God, they prouoke his wrath againſt them, who is able to deſtroy the body, and after to caſt body and ſoule into eternall torments. Matth. 10. 28.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we may obſerue what was the eſtate of this <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 28.</note> kingdome when this threatning was denounced by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; <note place="margin">No ſtrength can vphold that State which ſinne pulleth down.</note> namely, ſo ſtrong, flouriſhing, and proſperous, that the people feared nothing leſſe, then ſuch approching deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for they abounded at this time in multitude, munition, walled townes, and ſtrong holds; they had proſperous ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe againſt their enemies, and had obtained many famous victories; ſo that now they were lulled aſleepe in deepe ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, fearing no danger: and yet at this time God threatneth, and ſoone after bringeth vpon them ſudden deſtruction. Whence we learn, that there is no ſtrength nor power which will vphold any State, when the ſinnes thereof pull downe Gods iudgements vpon it. And therefore farre be it from vs to truſt in our owne multitude, power, and munition, and ſo
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:10737:40"/> to be mooued and incouraged thereby to goe on in our ſinnes; for the Lord can eaſily breake the bowe, and turne all humane ſtrength into weakeneſſe; ſo that when it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming greateſt we truſt therein, it ſhall moſt faile and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs.</p>
               <p>And ſo much for the ſubiect of the puniſhment. In the laſt place is ſet downe the place, where this puniſhment ſhould <note place="margin">Expoſition.</note> principally be inflicted; namely, <hi>in the vally of Iizreel:</hi> which was a ſpatious plaine, ten miles in length, ſituated by the <note place="margin">Hierome.</note> Citie <hi>Iizreel,</hi> and extended it ſelfe neere vnto <hi>Samaria;</hi> where in a battaile fought between the Aſſyrians and the Iſraelites, the people of Iſrael were ouerthrowne.</p>
               <p>Where firſt wee may obſerue, that they were not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in a ſtrange Country, or in ſome place of diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; <label type="milestone">

               <p>Secondly, as the Lord by ouerthrowing them in this chiefe place of their ſtrength, did teach them the vanity of their <note place="margin">We muſt be admoniſhed by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of others.</note> ſelfe-confidence: ſo doth he hereby iuſtly and fitly puniſh an other ſinne of theirs; namely, the neglect of his former iudgements: for in this valley the Lord had brought a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full deſtruction vpon the family of <hi>Ahab,</hi> for their groſſe idolatry: of which the Iſraelites ſhould haue made profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vſe, by flying their ſinnes, leſt they ſhould be ouertaken with their puniſhments: but they neglecting this example, which the very ſight and name of the place ſhould haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually called to their remembrance; and going forward in their blinde ſuperſtition and idolatry, the Lord in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſame place brought vpon them the very like deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>The vſe which we are to make hereof is this, that we take

                  <hi>God ſaid vnto him; Call her name Lo-ruchamah: for I will no more haue pity vpon the houſe of Iſrael: but I will vtterly take them away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas the Prophet ſaith, that his wife conceiued yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, he ſheweth, that there was a certaine ſpace or diſtance <note place="margin">Expoſition.</note> of time betweene the birth of the two children: by which he ſignifieth, that the Lord after that he had for their ſinnes inflicted vpon them the firſt puniſhment, would not preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring vpon them his ſecond and more grieuous iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but would giue them ſome reſpite and time of repentance, that ſo turning vnto him, hee might ſpare them and receiue them to mercy. For if they had, after they were ouerthrowne and led captiues, vnfainedly repented of their ſinnes, the Lord would haue had compaſſion on them, and receiued them into his loue and fauour. But when they obſtinately continued in their impenitency, the Lord refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to ſhew mercy vnto them. And this he ſignifieth by the birth of the ſecond child.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by this ſecond birth the Lord ſheweth, that they made no good vſe of his former iudgements, but grew
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:10737:41"/> from bad to worſe: and therefore his iuſtice required, that he ſhould lay vpon them a ſecond puniſhment, much more grieuous then the former.</p>
               <p>And theſe things are to be gathered out of her ſecond con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It is further ſaid, that her ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d child was a daughter: by which he intimateth their declining, both in reſpect of their maners and ſtate; the former whereof was the cauſe of the latter. Firſt, he ſheweth their declination in manners: for as the woman ſexe is more weake and inconſtant then the man; ſo they were declined from that ſtrength of faith, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and conſtancy that was in <hi>Iacob,</hi> and the reſt of their godly anceſtors, and were become weake and inconſtant in all good things. Secondly, he ſheweth their declination, in reſpect of the ſtate of their Common-wealth. For whereas their anceſtors had valiantly defended and inlarged the Kingdome againſt all their enemies, they were ſo weakened, partly through their effeminateneſſe, the daughter of peace and plenty, and partly through ſeditions and ciuill warres, that they had made themſelues a fit pray for their enemies, being no more able to defend themſelues, then if they had been a Common-wealth of women. And this weakeneſſe and infirmity is ſignified vnder the ſexe of women in the Scriptures. So when God would ſignifie that the Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhould not be able to ſtand in the hand of their enemies, he ſaith; that they ſhould be like women: that is, weake and impotent: Ier. 50. 37. Now this weakeneſſe in their ſtate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ier.</hi> 50. 37.</note> from their weakeneſſe in grace, vertue, faith, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy: for when they declined from holy obedience, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a weake and inconſtant manner, ſuffered themſelues to bee withdrawne from God, and were inticed to ſerue idols, God tooke away from them their valour, ſtrength, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly courage; and depriuing them of their hearts of men, gaue them womens hearts, which cauſed them to be ſo effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, timerous, and cowardly, that they durſt not indure the leaſt incounter of their enemies.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the things ſignified by the ſexe. The next thing to be conſidered, is the name: <hi>Call her name lo-rucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah.</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:10737:41"/> The ſignification whereof is, <hi>without mercy,</hi> or, <hi>not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining mercy:</hi> or as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> expoundeth it, Rom. 9. 25. <hi>Not</hi> (through Gods mercy) <hi>beloued.</hi> The which name is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 25.</note> giuen, to ſignifie that the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> after they were led captiue by the Aſſyrians, ſhould neuer obtaine, either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, or for the time to come, Gods mercy, to be reſtored againe into their Country.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of theſe words, concerning the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                  </label> impoſition of the name. The doctrines which ariſe from <note place="margin">Gods mercy euen in his puniſhments.</note> hence are diuers. Firſt, me may obſerue Gods gratious good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, in his manner of puniſhing men for their ſinnes: after he hath ſmitten them once, he doth not preſently ſtrike a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; but he pauſeth and giueth time and reſpite, that they may make profitable vſe of his former viſitation, and amend their faults for which they were puniſhed, that ſo he may not be moued to redouble their puniſhment; as it appeareth in his dealing with the Iſraelites in this place. Whereby it is manifeſt, that he taketh no pleaſure in our paine and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but in puniſhing aimeth at our amendment, that ſo we may be eternally ſaued: and therefore, as he is hardly drawne to puniſh, ſo when he hath begun, he is loth to go forward; but hauing like a gratious father, giuen vs a few ſtripes, he laieth the rod aſide, expecting our amendment, that ſo he may no more puniſh vs. And thus he dealt with the Iſraelites in the time of the Iudges, &amp; in the captiuity of Babylon; and with vs likewiſe, as at many other times, ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in the daies of Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> and in our late vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we may obſerue in the example of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, <note place="margin">That we quickly forget Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> how ſoone we forget Gods iudgements when they are once paſt, making no good vſe of them, nor amending thoſe faults for which we were puniſhed: but when the affliction is once paſt, we ſecurely go forward in ſinne, and become worſe then we were before; as though now God had emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied his quiuer, and had not one arrow of wrath and venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance more to ſhoote at vs. A notable example hereof we haue in <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> yea and in our owne times: for how few is
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:10737:42"/> the number of thoſe, who haue made any profitable vſe of Gods late viſitation? Nay, how many are there, who (as though hauing eſcaped that, they were priuileged from all others) are growne worſe and worſe? This is a miſerable euill, of which the Lord complaineth, Eſa. 1. 5. and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1. 5.</note> of vtter deſtruction. For as the father when hee ſeeth his child (after hee hath often corrected him for his faults) grow thereby more ſtubburne and diſobedient, iudgeth him paſt all grace, and without hope of amendment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore giueth him ouer and thruſteth him out of his houſe: So doth God deale with vs all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we may here learne, that if hauing one affliction or puniſhment laid vpon vs, we do not make good vſe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">If Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doe not amend vs, he will inflict greater pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.</note> of for our amendment, but caſting Gods iudgements behind our backs, become more and more ſtubburne and rebellious, the Lord will ſurely increaſe our puniſhment, if we increaſe in ſinne, vntill he haue brought vs to vtter deſtruction: for the pit of his vengeance can neuer be drawne drie, neither will he euer want thunderbolts of his wrath of all ſizes to dart againſt ſinners, ſinne they neuer ſo often; but after a plague, he can ſend a famine, after famine the ſword, after priuate euils publike miſchiefes, after corporall, ſpirituall, and after temporarie eternall puniſhments. And this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 26. <hi>Deu.</hi> 28.</note> by the former examples of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the Iſraelites in the time of the Iudges, and in this place; and this wee likewiſe ſhall find true by our owne experience, if we do not in this time of reſpite make vſe of Gods former iudgements. For the Lord hath pulled backe his hand to ſpare vs if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but if we ſecurely go on in our ſinnes, he is in this time and ſpace but lifting vp his hand, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he may ſtrike the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtroke.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing which we will here obſerue is, that if wee decline in our vertues, graces and manners, we ſhall alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline <note place="margin">So much we decline in courage and ſtrength, as we decay in vertue.</note> in our ſtrength and manlineſſe; if we waxe cold in the zeale of Gods glorie, he will alſo coole our courage; and if with effeminate inconſtancie wee turne from him, hee will alſo effeminate our minds, and take away our valor, ſtrength
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:10737:42"/> and fortitude; and ſo becomming weake, impotent and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardly cowards, we ſhall bee made a fit pray for our weakeſt enemies. And thoſe who heretofore tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled at our names, whileſt ſeruing God he filled our hearts with courage, and our hands with ſtrength, ſhall after our defection, when our hearts are changed and made effeminate, giue vs ſhamefull foiles and obtaine an eaſie victorie. And this appeareth in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joſ</hi> 7.</note> the example of the Iſraelites, Ioſua 7. in the time of the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: in the reigne of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> and the reſt of the <note place="margin">

               <p>And ſo much for the ſecond puniſhment, as it is ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnder the name of the Prophets child. Now wee are to conſider of it as it is plainely expreſſed in the reaſon giuen why this name is impoſed: <hi>For I will no more haue pitie vpon the houſe of Iſrael, but I will vtterly take them away.</hi> The words in the originall, are, <hi>For I will not adde, go forward,</hi> or <hi>continue</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Expoſition.</note> 
                  <hi>to haue mercy.</hi> By which he ſignifieth, that howſoeuer hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had multiplied his mercies vpon them, and after that he had caſt them off for their rebellions, had often receiued them againe into his former loue and fauour; yet now ſeeing they had abuſed his mercie and patience, he would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed any longer to ſhew mercie, but the acceptable time of grace being paſt, he would inflict his iudgements vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which long agoe they had deſerued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For I will no more haue pitie.</hi> The word here vſed ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth generally to haue mercie, but is fitly here tranſlated pity: for whereas there are two kinds of mercie, the one ſpirituall, the which eſpecially ſheweth it ſelfe in the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes; the other temporall, whereby the Lord ſeeing the miſery of men pitieth them, and in his tender compaſſion deliuereth them out of temporarie affliction; the former kind of mercie God denieth not to the Iſraelites, ſeeing none are excluded from this mercie, who repent and beleeue; but the latter, namely, freedome and deliuerance out of their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable captiuitie.</p>
               <p>Whereas therefore the Lord ſaith, that hee will no more
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:10737:43"/> haue mercie vpon them, his meaning is, that he will not anie more in pitie and compaſſion deliuer them out of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hands, as he had done in former times: as in the daies of <hi>Ioaſh,</hi> 2. King. 13. 23. 25. from the Aramites: and in the daies <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 13. 23. 2. <hi>King.</hi> 14. 26.</note> of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> 2. King. 14. 26. 27. beſides thoſe manifold de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerances in the time of the Iudges; <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Dauid;</hi> but that now their enemies ſhould for euer haue the dominion ouer them.</p>
               <p>It followeth: <hi>But I will vtterly take them away.</hi> The which words are diuerſly tranſlated. The Vulgar readeth it, <hi>I will vtterly forget them,</hi> as though this ſhould be the ſenſe, I will be ſo farre from pitying them, that I will not ſo much as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them. But this tranſlation the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>And ſo much for the meaning of the words. The doctrines which from hence we gather, are theſe. Firſt, whereas he ſaith, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                  </label> that he will no longer proceede to haue pity on them; hence <note place="margin">Gods former mercies abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, doe not exempt vs from future iudgements.</note> we learne, that it is a falſe inference which carnall and ſecure men make, namely, that becauſe the Lord hath multiplied his mercies vpon them in former times, therefore they are ſure that he will do ſo ſtill, notwithſtanding that they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually abuſe his mercie, and take occaſion thereby to go on in their ſinnes without repentance. For this was the caſe of the Iſraelites in this place, againſt whom he threatneth that he would turne his mercies into iudgements. It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, that Gods faithfull children may make ſuch concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, from their former experience of Gods mercies, in his
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:10737:43"/> ſpirituall gifts and graces, for in them hee is vnchangeable: Rom. 11, 29. And alſo concerning temporall benefits, ſo <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 29.</note> farre foorth as they will ſtand with their ſpirituall good; as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, 1. Sam. 17. 37. But this is no ſure ground where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 37.</note> ſecure men may build their preſumption. For if Gods mercies will not moue vs to feare and ſerue him, he will not alwaies continue to be mercifull towards vs, but as he hath a time for mercie, ſo he hath alſo a time for iudgement, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he will vtterly take vs away in wrath, and bring vs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. An example whereof wee haue in this place, and before the flood: Gen. 6. 3. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas the Lord threatneth that they ſhould <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 3.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Captiuitie is the fruit of rebellion.</note> for euer remaine in captiuitie, vnder the rule and dominion of their enemies, here we may obſerue a notable fruite of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. For ſo long as the Iſraelites ſerued God, whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice indeed is the only true libertie, they were freed from all ſeruitude and bondage: but when they refuſed to ſerue God as their Lord and maſter, &amp; would not be ruled by his word and Spirit, they were compelled to ſerue crueli tyrants in a miſerable and perpetuall ſeruitude; yea, which was worſe, they were not onely the captiues of their enemies, but the perpetuall bondſlaues of their arch enemie the diuell, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as did not turne vnto God and againe betake themſelues to his ſeruice.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas the Lord pronounceth this definitiue <note place="margin">Releaſe from temporall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions doth not alwaies follow true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1. 10. 2. 20</note> ſentence, that he would neuer haue pitie on them to deliuer them out of their bondage, and yet vpon the true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of many of them, pardoned their ſinne, and receiued them to mercie, as appeareth verſ. 10. chap. 2. 20. hence wee learne, that vpon the forgiuenes of ſinne, and reconciliation with God, there doth not alwaies follow releaſe from tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall afflictions, which for ſinne are inflicted vpon the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. For the Lord after that he hath pardoned his children their ſin, doth oftentimes chaſtiſe them afterwards for them, that hereby he may weane them, for the time to come, from their corruptions, and with this bitterneſſe of affliction may moue them to hate thoſe ſinnes, which otherwiſe would be

               <p>This gratious promiſe of mercie and ſaluation, is made to the Iewes, not for any excellencie or worthines, which was in them, which deſerued ſuch grace and mercie; for they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo oftentimes had grieuouſlie rebelled againſt the Lord, and had prouoked his wrath againſt them with their manifold ſins, which reigned amongſt them, eſpecially by their groſſe idolatrie, as may appeare both by the hiſtorie in the bookes of the Kings and Chronicles, and in the writings of the Prophets, which were ſent vnto them, to wit, <hi>Eſay, Ieremie,</hi> and the reſt.

               <p>Now the reaſons why this our Prophet which was ſent to the Iſraelites, maketh this gracious promiſe in the name of the Lord, of that mercy and ſaluation vnto the Iews, which was denied vnto the Iſraelites, was, firſt, that he might hereby awaken them out of their deepe ſleepe of carnall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and beate downe their pride and ſelfe confidence, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which their preſent proſperity had brought them. For at this time the Kingdome of Iſrael exceedingly flouriſhed both in multitude, as containing in it ten Tribes, and in ſtrength and all warlicke prouiſion; hauing obtained many great victories ouer their enemies, and particularly againſt the Iewes, whom they had ouerthrowne and brought into great extremity; in wealth alſo, which they had gotten by ſpoiling their enemies, and namely the Iewes, whoſe Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they had robbed and carried away all their treaſures and veſſels of gold and ſiluer; whereas the Iewes were but a few in number, as being but one Tribe and a halfe, many of which were miſerably ſlaine by their enemies, disfurni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed of their warlicke munition and meanes of defence; and laſtly, ſpoiled of their riches and treaſures, which are the ſinewes of warre; and ſo brought into miſerable pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In all which reſpects the Iſraelites deſpiſed the Iewes, and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:10737:45"/> proudly inſulted ouer them in their miſeries; yea and which was worſt of al, they combined themſelues with the Syrians, the enemies of God, &amp; conſpired how they might bring the poore afflicted Kingdome of <hi>Iuda</hi> to vtter ruine; as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, Eſay, 7. 5, 6. And therefore the Lord, to beate down this <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 7. 5, 6.</note> pride and cruell inſolency, ſendeth his Prophet to foretell their deſtruction, who were many, ſtrong, and abounding in all riches: and contrariwiſe, the preſeruation and ſaluation of the Iewes, who were few, weake, and in want of all things, but want of miſery.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe he was a Prophet ſent, not to the Iewes, but to the Iſraelites: he doth not meddle with their ſinnes, which were many, nor denounceth Gods iudgements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; but leauing that to their owne Prophets, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth himſelfe to his owne people, by all meanes ſeeking to humble and bring them to true repentance: and becauſe this promiſe of ſaluation and mercy vnto the Iewes, was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall to this purpoſe; therefore he reciteth it, that their hearts being wounded with griefe and emulation, and their pride and inſolency being beaten downe, they might in ſome ſort be prepared for true repentance.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the vnderſtanding of the firſt point. The doctrines which from hence we learne, are theſe. Firſt, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrines. </seg>
                  </label> 
                  <note place="margin">That in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties God hath aſpeciall care ouer the faithfull.</note> that when the Lord exerciſeth his iudgements vpon the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, he hath in the meane time a ſpeciall care of the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of thoſe that feare and ſerue him, to deliuer them out of the middeſt of common calamities; as appeareth in this place: for though he ſuffered the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne by their enemies; yet he ſo curbeth them in with the ſtrong raine of his prouidence, that they could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the next bordring countrie of Iuda, whom they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with equall malice, albeit they were much fewer in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and weaker in power, and in outward appearance alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnable to make any reſiſtance. And this is manifeſt by many ſuch examples of like deliuerances out of common euils. So was <hi>Noah</hi> preſerued in the common deluge, <hi>Lot</hi> in the deſtruction of Sodom, the Iſraelites from the plagues
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:10737:45"/> of <hi>Egypt.</hi> For the iuſt Iudge of heauen and earth, will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the iuſt with the wicked: Gen. 18. 25. And <hi>the Lord knoweth to deliuer the godly out of tentation, and to reſerue the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 25. 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>vniuſt to be puniſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, we here learne, that though our ſinnes be great, <note place="margin">Gods mercy to thoſe that repent.</note> and our imperfections and corruptions manifold; yet this will not withhold from vs the courſe of Gods mercies, if we turne to God by repentance. The Iewes were not much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde the Iſraelites in rebellion, idolatry, and all wickednes; and yet becauſe they often forſooke their wicked waies, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when they were admoniſhed by Gods Prophets, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed with afflictions, and turned vnto God by true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; therefore the Lord promiſeth vnto them mercy and deliuerance: whereas the Iſraelites, who continued obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately in their impenitency, were giuen ouer of God to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſtruction. The like example we haue in <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſe, Peter</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> and many others.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we learne, that it is a notable argument to moue the Lord to ſpare a people, when as they maintaine amongſt <note place="margin">God ſpareth thoſe who maintaine his pure worſhip, though they be polluted with many corruptions.</note> them Gods pure and ſincere worſhip and ſeruice, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they are polluted with many corruptions and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections: but when as true religion is baniſhed or deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when Gods ſincere worſhip is neglected, and idolatry and ſuperſtition erected; this is a ſtrong motiue to cauſe the Lord to powre downe his fearefull iudgements; as appeareth in the example of the Iſraelites and the Iewes. Whileſt the wiſe continueth her loue and mariage fidelity towards her husband, he is content to beare with many infirmities, and to put vp many iniuries; but if ſhe violate her faith, and place her loue vpon a ſtranger, he is kindled with rage and iealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and will neuer indure ſuch intolerable wickedneſſe: ſo whileſt the Church, which is Gods ſpouſe, continueth in her loue, and obſerueth her mariage promiſe, that ſhe will obey and reſpect him aboue all; he is content to ſpare her, though ſhe be full of corruptions and imperfections: but when ſhe withdraweth her loue, and ſetteth it vpon idols, and diſclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming her promiſed obedience, neglecteth his pure religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:10737:46"/> ſincere worſhip and ſeruice; then will his iealouſie burne like fire, and his wrath wil ſuddenly breake forth and vtterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume her, being now no better then an adulterous harlot. It is true indeed, that where Gods true religion is eſtabliſhed, and his Goſpell ſincerely preached; there, if the people doe not liue according to their profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; bring forth the fruits thereof, it will not priuiledge them from afflictions and puniſhments; nay rather the Lord will firſt viſit them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are of his owne family; as appeareth, 1. Pet. 4. 17. Ier. 25. 29. Heb. 12. 6. Apoc. 3. 19. But theſe viſitations are in <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>Ier.</hi> 25. 29. <hi>Heb</hi> 12 6. <hi>Apoc</hi> 3. 19. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 32.</note> mercy, that by his fatherly chaſtiſements he may reclaime them, leſt running on in their ſinnes, they ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the world; as it is, 1. Cor. 11. 32. But yet ſo long as they doe not withdraw their loue from God, nor violate their faith, by neglecting Gods true religion, and his ſincere worſhip and ſeruice, and erecting idolatry and ſuperſtition, the Lord will not vtterly forſake them, nor altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his mercy from them; as we may ſee in the example of the Iewes, and haue ſufficiently learned by our owne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we here learne, that no vice is more intolerable <note place="margin">God abaſeth the proud.</note> in Gods ſight, then when by our proſperity, and Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and free benefits, we be puffed ſo vp in pride and ſelfe-confidence, that we deſpiſe, oppreſſe, and inſolently inſult a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thoſe, who are in affliction and miſery. For this was the cauſe which moued the Lord to withdraw his mercies and benefits from the Iſraelites, when as they abuſed them to pride; and to beſtow them vpon the Iewes, who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned and oppreſſed by them.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the firſt point. The ſecond is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits promiſed to the houſe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> firſt, in generall, that he <note place="margin">Expoſition.</note> will haue mercie vpon them, ſecondly, that he will in mercy ſaue and preſerue them from their enemies. In which bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits promiſed, there is a ſecret antitheſis, vnto the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threatned againſt the houſe of Iſrael, in the former verſe, they ſhould bee <hi>lo-ruchamah,</hi> ſuch as ſhould haue no mercie, but the houſe of <hi>Iuda</hi> ſhould bee <hi>ruchamah,</hi> that is,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:10737:46"/> ſuch as ſhould obtaine mercie: they ſhould be vtterly taken away, and neuer returne out of their captiuitie; but theſe how they ſhould alſo be led captiue, yet they ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue but a while in their ſeruitude, and at the end of 70. yeeres be againe reſtored into their owne countrie.</p>
               <p>The which benefits promiſed, were accordingly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: Firſt, in the daies of <hi>Ahaz,</hi> when they were deliuered out of the hands of <hi>Rezin</hi> King of <hi>Aram,</hi> and <hi>Pecah</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Remaliah;</hi> as it is Iſai. 7. 1. and alſo in the daies of <hi>Ezechias,</hi> when as the Lord gaue vnto them a meruailous deliuerance, by ſending his Angell to deſtroy the hoſt of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacharib,</hi> euen 185000. men, as appeareth, 2. King. 18. and <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 19. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 36. <hi>&amp;</hi> 37.</note> 19. and Eſa. 36. and 37.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, when as being led captiue into Babylon, he moued <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> to haue compaſſion on them, and to returne them againe into their owne Country.</p>
               <p>And this is that which is meant by theſe benefits promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrines. </seg>
                  </label> Now the things which hence are to be obſerued, are <note place="margin">All Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnder his mercy.</note> theſe. Firſt, that he includeth all his benefits promiſed, vnder the name of his mercy: to note vnto vs, that they doe not come vnto any by merit and deſert, but of free grace and Gods vndeſerued goodnes; for mercy doth not preſuppoſe merit, but rather miſery, both in regard of ſinne, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment due vnto it. And further, to aſſure vs that if we haue Gods mercy, and be in his fauour, we ſhall neede no benefit, either for our maintenance, or elſe our defence and preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; whereas on the otherſide, without this mercy we can haue no aſſurance of either.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we may obſerue, that he knitteth theſe two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <note place="margin">Mercy the cauſe of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</note> mercy and ſaluation, and ſetteth mercy in the firſt place, becauſe it is the cauſe of ſaluation, and the fountaine from which this ſtreame of our deliuerance floweth. Whence we learne, that when the Lord ſaueth and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs out of the hands of our enemies, we doe not aſcribe our deliuerance to our goodneſſe, workes or worthineſſe, but to Gods free mercy and vndeſerued grace.</p>
               <p>The third thing to be conſidered, is the meanes whereby <note place="margin">Expoſition.</note>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:10737:47"/> the Lord would ſaue them; which are deſcribed: firſt affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiuely, <hi>by the Lord their God:</hi> and after negatiuely, where the falſe and inſufficient meanes are remoued; <hi>And will not ſaue them by bow,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt: <hi>by the Lord their God;</hi> we are to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the true Meſſias Ieſus Chriſt, the eternall <hi>Iehoua</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 24.</note> with his Father and holy Spirit; who onely ſaueth and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth his Church out of the hands of their enemies, and procureth for them eternall ſaluation and happineſſe: firſt, as the meritorious cauſe; for his ſake and merits we haue ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and all other benefits deriued vnto vs from God the Father; who if he ſhould behold vs out of his Sonne in our ſinnes and corruptions, would in ſtead of benefits, heape vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs plagues and puniſhments; and in ſtead of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would plunge vs into euerlaſting death and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And ſecondly, as the efficient cauſe of our ſaluation: for the Father ſaueth vs, but by his Son, who is his ſtrong pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whereby he not onely created vs, but alſo hath redeemed and ſaued vs.</p>
               <p>Moreouer he ſaith, that he would ſaue them <hi>by the Lord their God,</hi> rather then that he would ſaue them by himſelfe: to the end that he might hereby ſignifie, not onely that the houſe of <hi>Iuda</hi> did make choyce of him the true God, whom they worſhipped and ſerued; but alſo that he was not the God of the Iſraelites, ſeeing they had forſaken him, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken themſelues to the worſhip of idols.</p>
               <p>But here it may be demanded, how this can be true, that he was not the God of the Iſraelites, but of the Iewes onely, ſeeing he profeſſeth himſelfe to be the God of all the ſeed of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and alſo ſeeing the Iſraelites at this time, profeſſed that they ſerued him in their idols? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that God accounteth himſelfe to be no God vnto them, who had refuſed him; and that they had in truth refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, whatſoeuer ſhew and profeſſion they made to the contrary, when as they did not worſhip him after the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript forme of his word, but in hypocriſie and in idols; not in his temple, vnto which place hee had limited and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:10737:47"/> reſtrained his publike worſhippe, but in groues and high places.</p>
               <p>And this was the true meanes whereby he would ſaue them. In the next place hee expreſſeth and remooueth the falſe and inſufficient meanes of their ſaluation: <hi>And will not ſaue them by bow, nor by ſword, nor by battell, by horſes nor by horſemen.</hi> As though hee ſhould ſay, Although they bee ſo weake, poore and impotent, as that they may appeare vnto themſelues and others to lie open for a pray to their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, yet this ſhall bee no meanes to hinder their ſaluation and deliuerance, ſeeing my purpoſe is not to ſaue them by any power, riches or meanes of their owne, but by mine owne might, which without all humane helpe, is in it ſelfe omnipotent and omniſufficient.</p>
               <p>Whereas then he ſaith, that hee will <hi>not ſaue them by bow, nor by ſword,</hi> &amp;c. his meaning is, that hee would not ſaue them by their owne power and ſtrength, or by any humane and worldly meanes, but that their deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſhould whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie come from, and by himſelfe: the which accordingly was effected; firſt, in the reigne of <hi>Ezekias,</hi> when as being inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the mightie hoſt of <hi>Senacharib,</hi> hee cauſed his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell to ſlay 185000. of their enemies, and ſo without their owne bow, ſword, or battell deliuered them. And after that they were led captiue into <hi>Babylon,</hi> he gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> grace in the eies of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius;</hi> and when otherwiſe they were altogether vnable by force to relieue themſelues, he cauſed their enemies in pitie and compaſſion to free them out of captiuitie, and to reſtore them againe into their owne coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſon why the Lord excludeth all their owne ſtrength and meanes, was, firſt to beate downe the pride and inſolencie of the Iſraelites, who thought it impoſſible that the houſe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> in regard of their weakeneſſe, pouertie, and ſmall number ſhould bee deliuered out of their hands, eſpecially, hauing combined themſelues with the Syrians, to worke their ouerthrow; and ſecondly, to ſtrengthen the Iewes in the aſſurance of their deliuerance, notwithſtanding
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:10737:48"/> they ſaw no poſſible meanes in regard of humane power; which was exceeding needfull, conſidering that through our naturally corruptions, we are readie to doubt of our deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, when as we are abandoned of outward helpes.</p>
               <p>And this is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meaning of theſe words. The doctrines which <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The doctrines. </seg>
                  </label> from hence ariſe are theſe. Firſt, wee may obſerue, that the <note place="margin">1. That we haue all bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits from God in, and for Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</note> ſaluation of Gods Church and elect children, and all other benefits which they receiue, either ſpiritual or temporal, is in and for Ieſus Chriſt alone; and not from their owne meanes, nor for their own merits. And this appeareth in this place, where the Lord promiſeth to ſaue the Iewes out of the hands of the enemies, but not by their own means, but in the Lord their God, the promiſed Meſſiah. And as this is true concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our temporall deliuerances, ſo eſpecially concerning our eternall ſaluation; for there is <hi>not ſaluation in any other,</hi> &amp;c. Act. 4. 12. <hi>And he is able perfectly to ſaue all thoſe who</hi>

                  <hi>come vnto God by him:</hi> Heb. 7. 25. The vſe hereof is, that wee doe not with the Papiſts looke for ſaluation elſewhere, not in our owne merits, nor in the merits and interceſſion of Saints; nor aſcribe the glorie hereof in part or whole to any other, ſauing our onely Sauiour Chriſt, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing which we obſerue, is, that the onely true <note place="margin">2. Iehouah wil be their God alone, who worſhip him according to his word.</note> Iehouah is the God of thoſe alone, who worſhip and ſerue him, after his will reuealed in his word: as for thoſe that in ſtead of Gods reuealed truth imbrace their owne wil-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, though they make neuer ſo glorious a profeſſion of their ſeruice to the true Ged, yet he eſteemeth it not as done vnto him; neither will he acknowledge them his ſeruants, nor himſelfe their God, who in ſtead of his wil do their own wills, and in ſtead of his pure ſeruice, offer vnto him their owne inuentions. Whereas contrariwiſe, hee vouchſafeth to bee called the God of them, who worſhip him after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed will, though otherwiſe their obedience be mingled with many corruptions and imperfections, as appeareth in the example of the Iſraelites, and the Iewes in this place.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we here learne whence we are to expect deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, <note place="margin">3. Saluation is onely from the Lord.</note> and ſaluation out of the hands of our enemies; not
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:10737:48"/> from our own ſtrength, munitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, number, riches, friends, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſaluation commeth not from our ſelues, or from our own meanes, but from the Lord alone. And therfore when we abound in theſe things, we muſt not truſt in them (and ſo grow proud in our owne ſtrength) but in Gods helpe and promiſed aſſiſtance: and when theſe things are wanting, let vs not deſpaire of deliuerance, ſeeing the Lord without, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue, or contrarie to theſe meanes, can ſaue and preſerue vs by his owne omnipotent power: as appeareth in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Iſraelites, deliuered out of the captiuitie of <hi>Egypt,</hi> out of the hands of the Madianites, by <hi>Gedeon</hi> and his 300. men: Iudg. 7. from the power of <hi>Sanacherib,</hi> by his <note place="margin">

And ſo <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 14 6.</note> in our greateſt weakenes and want of meanes, we may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort our ſelues in the Lords aſſiſtance which is al-ſufficient, and ſay with <hi>Ionathan: It is not hard to the Lord, to ſaue with many, or with few,</hi> 1.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:10737:49"/> firſt typically ſhadowed vnder the childs name, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards plainely expreſſed in the reaſon rendred thereof.</p>
               <p>But before this third puniſhment is denounced, there is a certaine ſpace interpoſed betweene it and the former, which is ſignified verſ. 8. <hi>Now whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe had weaned Loru-chamah,</hi> &amp;c. By the weaning of <hi>Loru-chamah,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Prophet typically ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that becauſe the people were not reclaimed with the former puniſhments, the Lord would be ſo far from repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his ſentence of thoſe iudgements before denounced, that he would now ratifie and confirme it; yea, and becauſe their diſeaſes were growne ſo deſperate, that they were paſt all cure, and ſeeing neither mercies nor iudgements would reclaime them, he would now inflict vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a third iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, more heauie then all the reſt; namely, he would reiect them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being his people. But yet he would not do this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, but as the child is firſt weaned before it be taken from his nurſe, ſo they ſhould be weaned and reſtrained from their nurſes the Prophets, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the food of their ſoules, the milk <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 2.</note> of Gods word; of which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 1. Pet. 2. 2. and conſequently ſhould bee depriued of al the graces of Gods ſpirit, which are both begotten by this ſpiritual ſeed of Gods word, and nouriſhed and increaſed with this heauenly food.</p>
               <p>But howſoeuer the Lord goeth forward in the denunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of iudgements, yet it is not altogether without mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: for before he vtterly reiecteth them he interpoſeth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient diſtance of time between this and the former iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that in the meane while they might repent and ſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape this laſt puniſhment. And this alſo is ſignified by the weaning of <hi>Loru-chamah</hi> before <hi>Lo-ammi</hi> is conceiued. For though he had condemned them to perpetual captiuitie, yet he doth not preſently exclude them out of that couenant which he had made with their fathers, wherby they became his people, but for a time hee patiently waited for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, that ſo they might ſtill retaine the name of Gods people, and attaine vnto the ſaluation of their ſoules, though their bodies were inthralled in a perpetuall ſeruitude.</p>
               <p>But when as they made no vſe neither of Gods former iudgements, nor yet of his patience &amp; long ſuffering, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:10737:49"/> and deſperately went on in their ſins, they increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in wickedneſſe the Lord increaſeth his puniſhments, and finally caſts them off from being his people. The which finall reiection is ſignified and ſhadowed vnder the name <hi>Lo-ammi,</hi> the ſignification wherof is, <hi>Not my people,</hi> as it is expounded by God himſelfe in this place: and after it is plainely expreſſed in the reaſon: <hi>for ye are not my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: therefore I will not be yours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord had in former times made choice of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, amongſt all the nations of the world to be his Church and people, according to that, Deut. 32. 9. <hi>For the</hi>

                  <hi>Lords portion is his people: Iacob is the lot of his inheritance:</hi> with them hee made his couenant, and vpon them, as being his owne peculiar people, and proper familie, he multiplied his benefits, with a more liberall hand, then vpon any other nation. But when Iſrael obſerued not the condition of the couenant, but renounced the ſeruice of God, went a whoring after idols, and when neither Gods mercies would moue them to loue him, nor his iudgements to feare him, nor both ioyned together could reclaime them from their wicked waies, and bring them to repentance, the Lord caſteth them off as being a deſperate cure, and finally reiecteth them from being his Church and people.</p>
               <p>Yet he doth not preſently execute this laſt puniſhment, after he had inflicted the former; for after they were led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to captiuitie, and liued as captiues in the land of the Medes vnder the Empire and gouernment of the Aſſyrians, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſtill amongſt them ſome relicks of their owne man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of worſhip, and vſed their ceremonies in their owne aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, and in reſpect of this outward ſeruice and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion which was amongſt them, they had not altogether loſt the name of Gods people: but when as <hi>Deioce,</hi> the firſt King of the Medes, preuailed againſt the Aſſyrians, they were driuen out of the countrie of the Medes, and ſcattered into diuers parts of the world, ſo as they could not any more aſſemble together, nor exerciſe their owne worſhip, nor vſe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:10737:50"/> their owne ceremonies. And ſo mixing themſelues in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages with the Gentiles, and imbracing their religion, they were wholly excluded out of Gods couenant, and loſing both the name and priuiledges of the people of God, were numbred amongſt Pagans and infidels.</p>
               <p>But here it may bee demanded, how this can ſtand <label type="milestone">

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:10737:50"/> likewiſe with them returned out of their captiuitie; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth Ezra 2. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezra</hi> 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Moreouer, God no doubt had his number amongſt thoſe who were led captiue by <hi>Salmanaſſer;</hi> who though they loſt the outward name of Gods people, and the notes of a viſible Church, the purity of doctrine publikely preached, and the right vſe of the Sacraments publikely adminiſtred, yet they wanted not the ſpirituall graces of his Spirit, not were exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of his Church inuiſible: and howſoeuer they were reiected from the old couenant, yet they had their part in the couenant of grace.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, for the future time, many of theſe who were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ouer the face of the earth, after the comming and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of Chriſt, were by the miniſtery of the Apoſtles and Gods Miniſters, conuerted to the faith, and receiued toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Gentiles into the couenant of grace, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as true ſubiects of Chriſts Kingdome. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, becauſe the greateſt number of the people who were led captiue, remained in their impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, it might bee ſaid that <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be <hi>Lo-ammi,</hi> none of Gods people; the farre greater part giuing the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the whole.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place, as he reiecteth them from being his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo he denieth himſelfe to be their God; <hi>therefore I will not be yours:</hi> the Hebrew hath it, <hi>I will not be vnto you:</hi> the meaning is, that he would not be their God; which is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, but to be vnderſtood by mutual relation. So Ier. 11. 4. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 11. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Ye ſhall be my people, and I will be your God.</hi> But he vſeth this ſpeech as being more emphaticall, and doth not onely ſay vnto them, that he would refuſe to be their God; but that he would not be vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: intimating thereby, that they ſhould haue no manner of part or intereſt in him, nor any thing to doe with him for their benefit: ſo that though his being giueth being and all goodneſſe and happineſſe to his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet this ſhould not profit them, becauſe he would not be vnto them, &amp;c. As though he ſhould ſay; ſeeing you haue vngratefully abuſed my benefits, and ſtubbornely contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:10737:51"/> my iudgements, and notwithſtanding all the meanes I haue vſed to reclaime you, ye continue in your rebellion, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and hardneſſe of heart, forſaking me your gratious God, and neglecting my pure worſhip and ſeruice, and haue made choyce of falſe Gods, and committed with them from time to time groſſe idolatry: therefore, ſeeing you haue refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me, I will likewiſe refuſe you; ſeeing you reiect me from being your God, I will reiect you from being my people; and howſoeuer my being, being infinit in goodneſſe, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vnto thoſe that feare and ſerue me all happineſſe; yet it ſhall not be vnto you for your good and preſeruation, but rather as your ſinnes deſerue, for your puniſhment and vtter deſtruction.</p>
               <p>And ſo much for the meaning of the words. Now we are to ſet downe ſuch doctrines as do ariſe out of them. The firſt <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The Do∣ctrines. </seg>
                  </label> thing which here we obſerue, is, that when the people of Iſrael were not reclaimed with the two former puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <note place="margin">God inflicteth more heauie puniſhments where lighter will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vs.</note> the Lord goeth forward vnto the third, which was farre more grieuous then both the other; becauſe they did not onely goe forward in their former wickedneſſe, but alſo added this vnto the reſt, the neglect and contempt of Gods iudgements. So that this phyſicke of Gods correction, either worketh vpon the conſcience, and purgeth away the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of ſinne; or if it haue no operation, it maketh the party diſeaſed worſe then he was before, and moueth the Lord our Phyſitian, to adminiſter a purgation of greater force. And therefore let vs learne to make profitable vſe of leſſer puniſhments, or elſe the Lord will inflict thoſe which are more grieuous, either till he haue amended, or elſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed vs. Examples hereof we haue in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the Iewes, and many others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we may obſerue, that the more heauy the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is which is denounced, the longer the Lord deferreth <note place="margin">The greater the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, the more loath the Lord is to inflict it.</note> to inflict it; as though he were loth to vſe extremities, if mans wickednes did not deſerue it, and his iuſtice require it, ſeeing lighter puniſhments will not preuaile. When <hi>Iizreel</hi> was borne, <hi>Lo-ruchamah</hi> was ſoone after conceiued: but ſhe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:10737:51"/> conceiueth not <hi>Lo-amni,</hi> whereby the vtter reiection of the people was ſignified, before <hi>Lo-ruchamah</hi> was weaned: all which time the Lord gaue them to make vſe of his former iudgements, and expected their amendment with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble patience, that he might not vtterly reiect them. Wherein the Lord behaueth himſelfe like vnto a good and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Surgeon, who leaueth no good meanes vnaſſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, before hee will cut off the member which is ill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we may note, that before the Lord doth vtterly <note place="margin">God taketh away his liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie before he turne men out of his ſeruice.</note> reiect them from being his people, he firſt weaneth them from the milke of his word, and foode of his Sacraments, debarring them of all their publike aſſemblies, &amp; the meanes of his worſhip and ſeruice, and taking from them all their priuiledges and prerogatiues, which they inioyed whileſt they were his people. Like vnto Noble men, who vpon the ill behauiour of their ſeruants, firſt pull off their liuery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they turne them out of ſeruice: not onely becauſe they are vnworthy of any ſuch credit or protection, as it might cauſe vnto them; but alſo becauſe they ſhould not by abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelues in ſuch habits, diſhonour their Lords who haue reiected them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we may here obſerue the greatneſſe of this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, <note place="margin">That it is a fearefull pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to be reiected from being Gods people.</note> which may be conſidered in the ineſtimable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, whereof they were hereby depriued, and in the into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable euils and miſeries into which they were plunged: whileſt <hi>Iehouah</hi> was their Lord and King, they were vnder his protection, and ſo ſecured from the danger of all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; they were prouided for by his al-ſufficient proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and therefore ſure to want nothing; indued with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny noble titles, prerogatiues and priuiledges, as being his ſeruants, children, heires, yea his ſpouſe, partakers of many vnualuable benefites, temporall and ſpirituall, his word, Sacraments, and ſuch like; and after a ſhort time of their ſeruice here on earth, they were aſſured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue for wages, an immortall Crowne of glorie and eternall felicitie and happineſſe in his Kingdome. But as
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:10737:52"/> ſoone as they are caſt out of his Kingdome, and reiected from being his people, they were ſtripped of thoſe benefits, expoſed to the danger of their enemies, ſinne, Satan, and the world, who ſpeedily aſſault, and eaſily ouercome all thoſe who are out of Gods protection: and ſo taking them captiue, inthrall them in a miſerable ſeruitude, the wages whereof for the time preſent is miſery, horrour of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and deſperation, and in the life to come eternall death. Rom. 6. 23. As therefore we iudge their caſe moſt wretched, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23.</note> who hauing been the ſubiects and ſeruants of ſome gratious Prince, vnder whom they haue inioyed all the benefits of a peaceable and well gouerned kingdome, are for their crimes and miſdemeanors, baniſhed into a Country in it ſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable, and amongſt the middeſt of cruell enemies: ſo, and much more miſerable is the ſtate of thoſe who are baniſhed out of the kingdome of grace, where is all good and felicitie, and liue in the kingdome of Satan, where is nothing but all woe and miſery.</p>
               <p>And this is that puniſhment which here is threatned. Now let vs further conſider vpon whom it is inflicted: euen <note place="margin">Gods former mercies priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge not a rebellious people from future iudgements.</note> vpon the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the choſen people of God, vnto whom in former times, he had beſtowed innumerable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits. Whereby it appeareth, that though a people haue in former times been partakers of neuer ſo great priuiledges, and neuer ſo much inriched with Gods benefits, though God haue made his outward couenant with them of his grace, and the continuance of his fauour; yet if they breake their couenant, which interchangeably they haue made with God, denying vnto him their obedience, and liuing in all ſin and wickedneſſe; all this wil not priuiledge them from Gods fearefull puniſhments, no not from finall reiection and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. And therefore let vs not thinke it enough that God hath outwardly made his couenant with vs, vnleſſe it be alſo written in our hearts, and we perform, at leaſt in our holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour, that part thereof which concerneth our ſelues; for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we liue like his people and ſeruants, he wil not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge vs for ſuch, but will caſt vs off as he did the Iſraelites.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:10737:52"/>
               <p> Now the ſinnes for which eſpecially the Iſraelites were <note place="margin">Idolatrie and impenitencie, the cauſe of the peoples reiection.</note> reiected, were, firſt, their groſſe idolatrie whereby they had forſaken God, and betaken themſelues to the ſeruice of idols; and ſecondly, their obſtinacie and impenitencie in their courſe of rebellion, from which they would not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, neither by Gods bountifull benefits, nor by his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere threatnings, nor yet by his chaſtiſements and more grieuous puniſhments, which firſt like a tender father and after like a iuſt Iudge he inflicted on them, but rather grew worſe and worſe, and more and more intolerable in their wickedneſſe. For this is the laſt courſe and meanes which the Lord vſeth for the conuerſion of a ſinner, which when it will not preuaile, he giueth them ouer as being paſt all help, ſeeing they are paſt all grace. If the skilfull ſurgeon find that healing ſalues are not fit to heale a deep feſtered wound, he vſeth drawing corraſiues and the lancher, but if he ſeeth the part diſeaſed, notwithſtanding all good and fit meanes vſed to be paſt cure, he will no longer loſe his labour and coſt, but cutteth it off. The gratious Iudge, when he hath for the offenders firſt fault, giuen him ſome fatherly admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or threatned ſome ſeuere puniſhment; if he offend again, he puniſheth him with a whip, or with a burning iron; but if all theſe chaſtiſements and puniſhments will not reclaime him, he condemneth him to exile or death, as being paſt hope of amendment. And ſo the Lord, when he ſeeth that neither the healing plaiſter of his gracious promiſes, nor the ſharpe corraſiue of his threatnings and puniſhments will cure a people of the deepe feſtered ſores of ſinne; when hee ſeeth that neither admonition nor gentle chaſtiſement, nor ſeuerer puniſhment will reſtraine the ſinner from outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wickedneſſe, then doth he cut and caſt them off as men of a deſperate eſtate and paſt all cure. And this was the eſtate of the Iſraelites in this place; and of the Iewes, of whom the Lord complaineth, Eſa. 1. 5. and of <hi>Pharaoh, Saul,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1. 5.</note> and many others.</p>
               <p>The vſe which we are to make hereof is, that wee doe not neglect Gods mercifull viſitations and fatherly corrections,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:10737:53"/> leſt the Lord ſeeing vs vncorrigible, likewiſe reiect vs, as he did the Iewes, for <hi>If God ſpared not the naturall branches, let vs take heed leſt he doe not ſpare vs, who are but wild branches,</hi> as the Apoſtle reaſoneth, Rom. 11. 21. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 21. The Prophets holy bouldnes in deliuering his meſſage.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, we are to obſerue, that when the Prophet threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth againſt the people their finall reiection, they were in a moſt flouriſhing and proſperous eſtate, and therefore no doubt giuing ſmall credit to the Prophets words, it was an ambaſſage exceeding dangerous, expoſing him to the malice and outrages of an inſolent people. But yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding remembring who had ſent him on his meſſage he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth all theſe difficulties, and faithfully deliuereth the word of God which was put into his mouth.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, we may here learne, that though their preſent eſtate <note place="margin">Outward things no true ſigne of Gods loue or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.</note> were very proſperous, yet they were out of Gods fauour, and euen marked to vtter deſtruction: whereby it appeareth, that we cannot rightly iudge by outward things, either of Gods loue or hatred, ſeeing theſe things come alike to all, and the ſame outward condition is to the iuſt, and to the wicked, as the Wiſeman ſpeaketh, Eccleſ. 9. 1. 2. Nay often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 1. 2.</note> the wicked moſt flouriſh for a time, and the godly are afflicted, as appeareth in the example of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> the Egyptians and the Iſraelites, <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> the Phariſies and Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe and his Apoſtles. And therefore if wee iudge them in Gods fauour who are in a flouriſhing eſtate, and condemne them as miſerable who are in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we ſhall iuſtifie the wicked, <hi>and condemne the generation of Gods children,</hi> as it is Pſalm. 73. 15. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 73. 15. God reiecteth not his people before they reiect him.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly we may here obſerue, that God reiecteth not this people, before they had firſt reiected him, neither doth hee refuſe to rule and protect them as their Lord, before they had refuſed to obey him as his ſubiects.

                  <hi>number of the children of Iſrael ſhall be as the ſand in the ſea, which cannot be meaſured nor told. And in the place where it was ſaid vnto them, ye are not my people; it ſhall be ſaid vnto them; Ye are the ſonnes of the liuing God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Verſe 11. <hi>Then ſhall the children of Iuda, and the children of Iſrael be gathered together, and appoint themſelues one head; and they ſhall come vp out of the land: for great is the day of Izreel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which words is contained a ſweete conſolation for all Gods afflicted children, taken from the flouriſhing eſtate of <note place="margin">The expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</note> Gods Church, vnder the Kingdome and gouernment of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. The which their proſperitie and happineſſe, is firſt deſcribed in the 10. verſe, and part of the 11. verſe, and then magnified in the laſt words: <hi>for great is the day of Izreel.</hi> It is deſcribed by foure arguments. The firſt is their multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; that they ſhould be in number numberleſſe. The ſecond is their dignity; that they ſhould be not onely Gods people, but alſo the ſonnes of the liuing God. The third is, their vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and vnanimity; that they ſhould be gathered together, and appoint vnto themſelues one head, vnder whom they ſhould ioyntly be gouerned. The laſt is, their liberty and full redemption; that they ſhould come out of the land polluted with idolatry, and ſhould be adioyned vnto the true Church of God.</p>
               <p>The firſt argument of conſolation taken from the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Gods Church, is contained in theſe words: <hi>Yet the number of the children of Iſrael ſhall be as the ſand of the ſea, which cannot be meaſured nor told.</hi> Whereas he ſaith; <hi>Yet the number,</hi> &amp;c. he meeteth with an obiection of the hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Iſraelites; and withall, comforteth Gods children, who were deiected with the former threatnings. For the Prophet hauing ſhewed, that the Lord would reiect the people of Iſrael from being his people, the hypocrites among them would be ready to charge the Prophet, that his prophecie <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obiection. </seg>
                  </label> could not be true, ſeeing it contradicted Gods promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he would multiply his ſeed as the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:10737:54"/> ſtarres of heauen, and as the ſands by the ſea ſide; the which he ſhould not performe, if now he ſhould reiect and caſt them off. To which the Prophet anſwereth, that though God did reiect, all theſe rebellious Iſraelites, which were the ſeed <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
                  </label> of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh; yet he would be as good as his promiſe: which is to be vnderſtood of the ſeede of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> not according to the fleſh, but according to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: that is, both of the Iſraelites, and alſo the Gentiles, which ſhould in great numbers be gathered into the Kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt, and be true members of his Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas the faithfull might haue been ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed <note place="margin">The multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods Church, by ioyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Iewes and Gentiles.</note> with ſorrow, and troubled with many doubtings, when they heard of the vtter reiection of the Iſraelites; as though the Church of God ſhould thereby come to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine: the Prophet comforteth them, and ſtrengtheneth their ſaith againſt ſuch doubtings, by aſſuring them that the Lord would make good his promiſe, concerning the multiplying of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed as the ſtarres of heauen; and that this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection of the rebellious Iſraelites, ſhould be ſo far from hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of it, that he would in his infinit wiſedome, make it an occaſion of accompliſhing his promiſe, and multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Church; becauſe in regard of his promiſe made to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> he would in the miniſtery of the Goſpell by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Miniſters, call into his Kingdome of grace; firſt the Iſraelites, and then by occaſion of them, the Gentiles, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom they were ſcattered; and ſo of both, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of <hi>Abrahams</hi> poſterity, according to the fleſh, and of the beleeuing Gentiles his children, according to the ſpirit, he would multiply the number of his Church, like vnto the ſtars of heauen, and ſands by the ſea ſide in multitude.</p>
               <p>But let vs come more particularly vnto the words of the text: <hi>Yet the children,</hi> &amp;c. Here the Prophet ioyneth thoſe things which in their owne nature ſeeme to differ: as though he ſhould ſay; The former threatnings which I haue denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, may ſeeme to contradict Gods promiſe made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> concerning the multiplying of his ſeede; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the Lord will execute thoſe iudgements which
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:10737:55"/> I haue denounced, yet he is not vnmindfull of his promiſe, but will, though he caſt off the rebellious Iſraelites, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the true ſonnes and children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> conſiſting not onely of the beleeuing Iſraelites, but alſo of the beleeuing Gentiles, which by the preaching of the Goſpell ſhall be conuerted vnto the faith, and ſo adioyned to the Church, as the ſtarres of heauen, and like the ſands by the ſea ſide in number. And therefore the wicked Iſraelites haue no reaſon to inſult in their ſecurity, as though Gods Church could not ſtand if they fall, but muſt needes be ouerthrowne in their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine; and as if God could not be true of his word, vnleſſe they were preſerued and multiplied; ſeeing the Lord in his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſedome and power, can of ſtones raiſe vp children vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of vnbeleeuing Gentiles, make beleeuing <note place="margin">

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:10737:55"/> and alſo their ſpirituall regeneration; the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> both becauſe they iſſued out of his loynes, and likewiſe becauſe they were indued with his faith. And of theſe Chriſt ſpeaketh, Matth. 10. 5. <hi>Goe not into the way of the</hi>

                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 24.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes it is taken for thoſe which are not the ſons of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh, but according to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, borne vnto him not by nature, but by grace, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the promiſe, Gen. 17. 5. which were all the beleeuers <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 5.</note> amongſt the Gentiles that imbraced the faith of <hi>Abraham.</hi> And of both theſe latter kindes of Iſraelites, is this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie to be vnderſtood: firſt, of the beleeuing Iſraelites, which from the comming of Chriſt to the end of the world, ſhould be effectually called by the preaching of the Goſpell: neither are they here excluded (as ſome haue ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, who expound this prophecy onely of the calling of the Gentiles) ſeeing our Sauiour profeſſeth, that he was ſent in the firſt place to them: Math. 15. 24. And the Apoſtle, Rom. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 25, 26.</note> 11. 25, 26. That <hi>Iſrael likewiſe ſhall be ſaued, when the fulneſſe of the Gentiles is come in;</hi> and ſeeing many alſo by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of Chriſt and his Diſciples, were conuerted to the faith.</p>
               <p>But howſoeuer this prophecy is to be vnderſtood of them in the firſt place, yet not of them onely, but likewiſe of the beleeuing Gentiles, which were added to the beleeuing Iewes, and became one Church with them; as appeareth Ioh. 10. 16. And this is manifeſt; firſt becauſe otherwiſe, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 10. 16.</note> here made of multiplying the Iſraelites like the ſands by the ſea ſide in number, could not be verified, if it ſhould be vnderſtood onely of the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the fleſh, whereas it is fully accompliſhed, if it be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of his children according to the ſpirit; as the Apoſtle alſo ſheweth, Rom, 4. 16, 17, 18. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16, 17, 18.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the Apoſtle meeting with an obiection which might ariſe from the comparing of the ſmall number of thoſe who did beleeue, with the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:10737:56"/> concerning the multiplying of his ſeede as the ſtarres and ſands, which alſo is repeated in this place) affirmeth, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> children ſhould haue their name in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Rom. 9. 7. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 7, 8.</note> and expounding himſelfe, verſe 8. he ſaith; that they which <hi>are the children of the fleſh, are not the children of God, but the children of the promiſe are counted for the ſeede.</hi> So that all the elect of God, indued with the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are to be accounted his children, and the onely true Iſraelites. And this is ſignified when as it is ſaid, that his children ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who was not borne vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the courſe of nature; for <hi>Abraham</hi> was almoſt an hundred yeares old, and <hi>Sara</hi> was likewiſe ſtricken in yeares and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 19, 20.</note> but his birth was rather to be aſcribed to the free pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, apprehended by the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not to naturall ſtrength and ordinary generation. And hence it is that he is called the child of the promiſe, and not the child of the fleſh, as <hi>Iſmael</hi> was, who was borne according to the ordinary courſe of nature; and likewiſe according to his example, thoſe are reputed the true childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who are the children of the promiſe, begotten not according to nature, but Gods free grace, indued with the faith of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and not like <hi>Iſmael,</hi> his children onely according to the fleſh.</p>
               <p>And this may further appeare by plaine teſtimonies of Scripture: Rom. 4. 11, 12. the Apoſtle ſaith; that <hi>Abraham</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>was the father not onely of the circumciſed, but alſo of the vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, who beleeue and walke in the ſteps of his faith.</hi> The which argument he more fully handleth, verſe 13, 14, 15, 16, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 7.</note> 17, 18. Gal. 3. 7. <hi>They which are of faith, the ſame are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who was indued with the ſame ſpirit of God, that our Prophet was, and therefore moſt fit to interpret his meaning, expoundeth this prophecy of all the faithfull, both Iſraelites and Gentiles; as appeareth Rom. 9. 24, 25, 26. ſo Pet. 1. Epiſt. 2. 10. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 24, 25.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And thus it appeareth, whom we are to vnderſtand by the children of Iſrael. In the next place we are to conſider the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:10737:56"/> number of the Church, which is expreſſed comparatiuely: <hi>as the ſand in the ſea, which cannot be numbred nor told.</hi> In which words, he alludeth vnto the promiſe of God made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 22. 17. <hi>Therefore I will ſurely bleſſe thee, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>will greatly multiply thy ſeede as the ſtarres of the heauen, and as the ſand which is by the ſea ſhore,</hi> &amp;c. ſo Gen. 15. 5. and withall, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 5.</note> expoundeth that promiſe, ſhewing of whom it was meant; namely, of the whole Church of God, Iſraelites and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, who being indued with the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to be eſteemed his ſeed; as the Apoſtle likewiſe interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it, Rom. 4. 18. The like place vnto this we haue, Ier. 33. 22. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>By all which is ſignified, that the Church of God, after the comming of Chriſt, gathered together by the preaching of the Goſpell, ſhould be in numbers numberleſſe, euen like vnto the ſands by the ſea ſide: which, howſoeuer God, infinit in knowledge; can number, yet vnto man they are innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable. And not onely ſo, but that alſo it ſhould not, as in former times, be contained within the narrow limits of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but extend it ſelfe very ſpatiouſly ouer the face of the earth. For here he vſeth two words; the firſt is referred to a continued quantity of place; <hi>which cannot be meaſured:</hi> the other to a diſcrete quantity, that is, to the number or multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, <hi>which cannot be told.</hi> By both which ioyned together, he ſheweth, that the Church of God and Kingdome of Chriſt, ſhould be ſo ſpatious, that it ſhould be contained in no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, and ſo many in multitude, that it ſhould be defined with no number.</p>
               <p>But here it may be demanded, how this can ſtand with the ſaying of our Sauiour Chriſt, who calleth his Church a little flocke. I anſwer, that Chriſt ſpeaketh of it being compared with infidels &amp; worldlings which are not of the church; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of whoſe huge multitude, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> true church of Chriſt is but a little flock; but yet being conſidered in it ſelfe, the number thereof is great, euen like the ſtarres of heauen, and ſands by the ſea ſhore, which cannot be meaſured nor told.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the number of the Church. In the next place is ſet downe the time in which this increaſe of Gods
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:10737:57"/> people ſhould be; not in the time preſent, but in the time to come, euen after the comming of Chriſt, when by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell, the Gentiles ſhould be called and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Church of the Iewes. So that firſt the children of Iſrael, who were the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh onely, muſt be caſt off, before his children, according to the ſpirit, ſhould be receiued into the couenant: firſt the naturall branches of the Oliue muſt be broken off, becauſe they were vnfruitfull, and then the wilde branches muſt be grafted in; and therefore their reiection ſhould be ſo farre from bringing Gods Church to ruine, that God after their caſting off, would exceedingly multiply and inlarge it.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I ſhewed the meaning of the firſt point. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The Do∣ctrines. </seg>
                  </label> The doctrines which from hence ariſe, are theſe.

The Iſraelites reſting in the outward titles, of the poſteritie of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Church and people of God, and in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſome externall worſhip, conſiſting rather in ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, then in ſubſtance, in vaine ſhewes and ſhadowes, and not in ſpirit and truth; were hereby ſo puffed vp in pride, and lulled aſleepe in ſuch deepe ſecurity, that they imagined God could not be true of his word, vnleſſe they were preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and that there was no way, but the Church muſt needes vtterly periſh, if they were ouerthrowne and reiected: and therefore againſt all the threatnings of the true Prophets, they oppoſed theſe titles and ſhadowes, that they were the poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Church of God, his choſen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who were in the couenant, and ſuch as had the Temple, Arke, and Law amongſt them; and with theſe bucklers they fenced and bore off all threatnings of their ruine and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and kept them from wounding their conſciences with vnfained ſorrow for their ſinnes; and withall, were moued hereby to condemne the Prophets to be liars, who ſpake not

To theſe our Prophet by a Prolepſis anſwereth, that though they were the poſteritie of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> yet they were not true Iſraelites, but degenerated Iizreelites, ſuch as had onely outward titles, ſhewes, ceremonies, and external prerogatiues, but that they were not the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the ſpirit, not in the couenant of grace, which they had often broken, not the true Church and people of God, ſeeing they had forſaken him, and in ſtead of his true worſhip, which ought to be performed in ſpirit and truth, they offered vnto him a falſe worſhip, according to their owne inuentions, and in the hypocriſie of their hearts. And therefore though the Lord ſhould reiect them, yet this ſhould bee no impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his truth in his promiſes, nor bring any damage to the Church, for as much as he would in their ſtead, who were hypocrites, rotten members, and the ſonnes of <hi>Abraham</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly according to the fleſh, make choice of ſincere profeſſours, true beleeuers, and the ſonnes of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the ſpirit, vnto whom hee would make good his couenant and promiſe, and multiplie them in innumerable numbers.</p>
               <p>The like obiection at this day is made by the Papiſts in <note place="margin">The Papiſts like the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15.</note> their pride and ſecuritie, againſt thoſe who charge them with their errours and apoſtaſie. For, ſay they, the Church of Chriſt cannot erre, ſeeing it is the pillar of truth, 1. Tim. 3. 15. nor fall away in life or doctrine, ſeeing Chriſt hath promiſed to leade it in all truth, and to continue with it, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and guiding it by his word and ſpirit vnto the end of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 23. 20.</note> the world: but we (ſay they) are the Church of Chriſt, as may appeare by our vnitie, vniuerſalitie, antiquitie and ſucceſſion of Biſhops; and therefore if we fall away, the Church falles away, and conſequently Chriſt cannot bee true of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. But vnto them we may anſwere, as the Prophet to the Iſraelites, that they are the Church onely in name, and not in deede; ſeeing they haue forſaken the pure worſhip of God deſcribed in his word, and in ſtead thereof haue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced their owne wil-worſhip, ſuperſtition and idolatrie;
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:10737:58"/> and therefore they are not now the ſpouſe of Chriſt, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous harlots, which are for their whoredomes diuor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from him; they are not the true Church of God, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding thoſe outward titles and notes thy bragge of, ſeeing they want the chiefe and onely vnfallible notes of the true Church, Gods word ſincerely preached and his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments purely adminiſtred. And though they bee reiected, yet this will not infringe the truth of Gods promiſes made to his Church; neither will God want a Church, though they be caſt off: ſeeing in their places hee hath, and will multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie his faithfull children, the true poſteritie of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as the ſands by the ſea ſhore, vnto whom he will accompliſh his promiſes of his preſence, protection, and direction in all truth.</p>
               <p>The like obiection alſo is made by carnall goſpellers, and ſecure hypocrites, who profeſſing religion, doe in their liues denie the power thereof; and drawing neere vnto God with their lips, whileſt with their hearts, they goe farre from him, and therefore we may fit vnto them the like anſwere, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing which wee are to obſerue is, that the <note place="margin">The executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods iudgements no hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the performance of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes.</note> execution of Gods threatnings, is at no time any hinderance to the performance of his promiſes; nay, rather he vſeth the one as an occaſion of the accompliſhing of the other: as in this place the reiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the idolatrous Iſraelites, for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of his gratious promiſe concerning the multiplying of his Church, the true poſteritie of <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the ſpirit. And therefore when Gods faithfull children heare his fearefull denunciation of iudgements denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the wicked, let not them doubt that this will be an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to ſtay the performance of the gracious promiſes which are made vnto them; for although they bee not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in that maner, and by thoſe meanes which they expected; yet the Lord will not faile to performe them, ſo as in his infinite wiſedome hee knoweth moſt fit for his owne <note place="margin">The multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Gods people in the time of the Goſpell.</note> glorie, and their ſaluation.</p>
               <p>The third thing to be obſerued, is the great multitude of Gods people and children vnder the kingdome of Ieſus
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:10737:58"/> Chriſt, in the time of the Goſpel, for it is here ſaid, that God would multiplie them as the ſands and ſtarres. The Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites ſuppoſed that if they ſhould be reiected, God would want a Church and people to worſhip and ſerue him; but they were wholly deceiued, for vpon the occaſion of their reiection, who were but hypocrites, he multiplied the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his faithfull ſeruants. And as the riuer when the courſe thereof is ſtopped in his owne channell, breaketh ouer the bankes, and ouerfloweth the whole countrie, making it fruitfull which in it ſelfe was drie and baren: So the ſtreames of Gods ſauing mercies, which in former times plentifully flowed in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as in their proper current, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtopped, and as it were dammed vp, with the huge heape of their grieuous ſinnes, and traiterous rebellions, ran ouer the bankes and borders of <hi>Iurie,</hi> and ouerflowed the whole earth; making the Gentiles, who formerly had been barren in all goodnes, fruitefull in his ſanctifying graces and holy obedience. And this our Sauiour ſignified in the parable of the great Supper, to which the Iewes, who were the inuited gueſts, refuſing to come, vpon the occaſion of their refuſall, the ſeruants are ſent into the ſtreets, hedges, &amp; highwaies, to inuite the poore, maimed, halt, and blind Gentiles, that they might ſupplie their roomes, as appeareth, Luk. 14. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. The pride of hypocrits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued and beaten down.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The conſideration whereof, may ſerue to beate downe the pride of hypocrites, who thinke God beholding to them for their profeſſion and ſeruice; imagining that he will neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect them for his owne honours ſake, ſeeing if they were caſt off, he ſhould want ſeruants to worſhip and glorifie him. But let ſuch know, that God, who is in himſelfe abſolute, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit in all perfections, ſtandeth in neede of no man; and though it were ſuppoſed that he did, yet not of them, who by their ſeruing him, doe diſhonour him; for he is <hi>able of ſtones to raiſe vp children to Abraham,</hi> Matth. 3. 9. <hi>He can deſtroy</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Iob.</hi> 34. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>the mightie, and ſet vp others in their ſtead,</hi> as it is Iob 34. 24. When the Iewes forſake him, he can make the Gentiles ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable; when the ancient by their praiſes doe not glorifie him, hee can giue ſtrength to babes and ſucklings to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:10737:59"/> this dutie which they neglect, Pſalm. 8. 2. and though <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 8. 2.</note> they likewiſe ſhould ſay nothing, yet <hi>the heauens,</hi> with their dumbe eloquence, <hi>would declare the glory of God,</hi> Pſal. 19. 1. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 19. 1.</note> Yea, and if all theſe ſhould hold their peace, yet the ſtones themſelues would become the heraulds of Gods praiſes. Luk. 19. 40. And therefore let not hypocrites ſecurely goe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 40.</note> on in their ſinnes, thinking that for their outward ſeruice and profeſſions ſake, God will not reiect them; for (as the Lord ſpake of <hi>Coniah</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Iehoiakim,</hi> Ier. 22. 24) <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ier.</hi> 22. 24.</note> though they were the <hi>ſignet of his right hand, yet he wil plucke them off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas it is ſaid, that the Church of Chriſt <note place="margin">The dotage of the Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> ſhould be multiplied like the ſands by the ſea ſide; this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to confute the dotage of the Browniſts, who imagine that there is no true Church but themſelues, and ſuch as are reformed according to their owne phantaſies: an example whereof is not to be found in all Chriſtendome, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by their owne practiſe, who haue refuſed to ioyne with thoſe Churches which are moſt reformed. For if in the time of the Goſpell the Church of Chriſt muſt be multiplied like the ſands in number, then certainely it cannot be reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their conuenticles, ſcarſely deſeruing the name of a congregation.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, here we may obſerue the certaintie of the calling <note place="margin">The certentie of the calling of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</note> of the Gentiles; for the Iſrael of God muſt bee multiplied like vnto the ſtarres and ſands in number: but this cannot bee vnderſtood of the ſonnes of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the fleſh, whoſe number ſince the comming of Chriſt is not multiplied, but exceedingly diminiſhed: and concerning them God ſaith, <hi>that though the children of Iſrael were as the ſands of the ſea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet ſhall but a remnant be ſaued:</hi> Iſai. 10. 21. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſay.</hi> 10. 21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 27.</note> Rom. 9. 27. and therefore it muſt needs be vnderſtood of the whole Church of God, both Iewes and Gentiles gathered together, by the preaching of the Goſpell. The like teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies we haue concerning the calling of the Gentiles, Pſa. 2. 8. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 2. 8.</note> where God the Father promiſeth to his ſonne that he would <hi>giue him the heathen for his inheritance:</hi> and Eſa. 2. 2. it is ſaid, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 65.</note>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:10737:59"/> that <hi>all nations ſhall flow vnto the houſe of God.</hi> So Eſa. 65. 1. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Amos</hi> 9. 11. 12. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 16. The calling of the Gentiles miniſters mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ioy and thankfulneſſe.</note> Amos 9. 11. 12. Ioh. 10. 16.</p>
               <p>The conſideration whereof, as it miniſtreth vnto vs all ſound matter of conſolation, in that the wall of ſeparation is broken downe, ſo that the mercies of God haue as free a courſe vnto vs as euer they had to the Iewes: ſo it ſhould fill our hearts with true thankfulnes, and our mouthes with prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and thankſgiuing to God, who hath now effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vs and reconciled vs vnto himſelfe, which were not only ſtrangers but alſo enemies, vnworthie of his leaſt fauour, nay worthie of his eternal wrath and diſpleaſure; ſeeing we went forward in our ſins, in the blindnes of our minds and hardnes of our harts, not ſo much as deſiring grace &amp; reconciliation.</p>
               <p>And ſo much concerning the multitude of Gods Church. In the ſecond place is ſet downe the dignitie thereof: <hi>And in the place where it was ſaid vnto them, Ye are not my people, it ſhall be ſaid vnto them, Ye are the ſons of the liuing God.</hi> Where <note place="margin">Expoſition.</note> firſt is ſet downe the amplitude of the place, which ſhould receiue this ineſtimable priuiledge. Secondly, the parties or perſons who are exalted to this high dignitie. Thirdly, the meanes or inſtrument, whereby it ſhould be conferred. Laſtly, the dignitie and prerogatiue it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The amplitude of place is deſcribed in theſe words: <hi>And in that place where it was ſaid vnto them, ye are not my people.</hi> Others reade it thus: <hi>Et pro eo quod dicebatur,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and for that,</hi> or <hi>in ſtead of that,</hi> &amp;c. vnderſtanding it onely of the change of ſpeech, and not of amplitude of place: as <hi>Pagnine</hi> and <hi>Tremellius.</hi> But for as much as the other tranſlation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with the originall, with antiquitie, with their owne tranſlation of the like phraſe, Leuit. 4. 24. Ier. 22. 12. and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> inſpired with the ſame ſpirit, retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 4. 24. <hi>Ier.</hi> 22. 12.</note> the ſame, Rom. 9. 26. therefore I rather imbrace it then the other. The meaning of this phraſe is this, that God <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 26.</note> would gather vnto himſelfe a Church, not out of <hi>Canaan</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but out of al places, and from amongſt al nations, which were not called in times paſt the people of God, or which were called, <hi>Not my people.</hi> Now in all places and nations
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:10737:60"/> of the world it might be ſaid of them before the comming of Chriſt, that they were not Gods people, ſauing in Iudea onely: and therefore God here promiſeth, that his Church and the world ſhould haue the ſame limits, and that he would gather it out of all nations, which in times paſt had not been his people.</p>
               <p>The truth of which expoſition, may appeare by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeech here vſed; for it is not in the originall as in our tranſlations; <hi>in the place where it was ſaid;</hi> but, <hi>in the place where it ſhall be ſaid:</hi> not reſtraining it to the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> where they now were, but extending it to all the nations amongſt whom the Iſraelites were afterwards ſcattered; when, and not before, they were excluded from the name and priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods people.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be conſidered, is, the parties who are exalted vnto this high dignity; namely, they to whom it was <note place="margin">That we are called the people of God three waies. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 2.</note> ſaid; <hi>ye are not my people.</hi> Now we may be ſaid to be, or not to the people of God three waies: firſt, in reſpect of his eternall decree of predeſtination: ſo Rom. 11. 2. <hi>God hath not cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his people whom he knew before.</hi> Secondly, in reſpect of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the couenant of workes; in which reſpects the Iſraelites were called peculiarly the people of God: Deut. 7. 6. 14. 2, 26. 18. Exod. 19. 5, 6. Thirdly, in reſpect of our <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 6. 14. 2. 26 18. <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. 5, 6. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Tit</hi> 2. 14.</note> admiſſion into the couenant of grace: ſo Hoſ. 2. 1. Tit. 2. 14.</p>
               <p>In the firſt ſenſe we are not to vnderdand this place; for thoſe that are reiected in Gods eternall councell from being his people, ſhall neuer be called his ſonnes, ſeeing his decree is vnchangeable. Neither are we to vnderſtand it of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward admiſſion into the couenant of grace; for this coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant can neuer be broken betweene God and his people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo written in their hearts by his holy ſpirit, that they cannot depart from it; and thoſe whoſe ſinnes God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueth, he will neuer remember; as appeareth Ier. 31. 32, 33, 34. But it is to be vnderſtood of the couenant of workes; in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 32, 33.</note> which reſpect, both Iewes and Gentiles were ſaid, not to be Gods people. The Iewes, becauſe breaking the couenant,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:10737:60"/> they were reiected from being Gods people; as appeareth in the 9. verſe. The Gentiles becauſe they were neuer admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into it.</p>
               <p>Whereby it appeareth, who they are that are exalted to be the ſonnes of the liuing God; namely, both Iewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, ſeeing of both it was ſaid, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were not Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; of the Iſraelites, becauſe they were reiected; of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, becauſe they were not admitted. And thus the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> expoundeth it, Rom. 9. 23, 24, 25, 26.</p>
               <p>But howſoeuer this is ſpoken of both Iewes and Gentiles, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 23. 24.</note> that they ſhould be called the ſoones of the liuing God; yet not of all and euery of them: neither muſt we imagine that theſe two; <hi>not my people, and the ſonnes of the liuing God,</hi> are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like generall; as though all and euery man amongſt them, of whom it might be ſaid, <hi>not my people;</hi> of them it ſhould be ſaid, that they <hi>were the ſonnes of the liuing God:</hi> but it is to be vnderſtood of Gods elect onely, who ſhould be called from amongſt them both, and added to the Church. For many were eternally reiected; many who neuer heard of the Goſpel and of Chriſt; many outwardly called by the miniſtery of the word, who were not called effectually, and ſo neither iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor made Gods ſoones by adoption and grace.</p>
               <p>The third thing which is ſignified in theſe words, is the inſtrumentall cauſe or meanes, whereby they ſhould attaine vnto this dignity; namely, by the preaching of the Goſpell: the which is implied by the phraſe of ſpeech here vſed: for he doth not ſay; they ſhall begin to be, or they ſhall be made, or they ſhall be adopted the ſonnes of God; but, <hi>it ſhall be ſaid vnto them, Yee are the ſonnes of the liuing God:</hi> to wit, in the preaching of the Goſpell, which is the <hi>ſtrong power of God to ſaluation, vnto all that beleeue:</hi> Rom. 1. 16. and the onely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes of begetting faith: Rom. 10. 17. by which <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16. 10. 17. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 12. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 15.</note> faith, we attaine vnto this prerogatiue of being the ſonnes of God: Iohn 1. 12. And this the Apoſtle plainely ſheweth, 1. Cor. 4. 15. where affirming himſelfe to be the Corinthians ſpirituall father, who had begotten them vnto God, he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth likewiſe whereby they were begotten and regenerate;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:10737:61"/> namely, through the preaching of the Goſpell. Furthermore it is to be obſerued, that it is ſet down abſolutely, <hi>it ſhalbe ſaid vnto them;</hi> without expreſſing by whom: but we are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of God himſelfe, who had ſaid, <hi>ye are not my people:</hi> for he onely after their reiection from being his people, could make them his ſonnes: notwithſtanding we are not to vnderſtand it, that this ſhould be ſpoken by God himſelfe immediately; but as he ſaid, <hi>yee are not my people,</hi> by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of his Prophet; ſo he ſaith, <hi>yee are the ſonnes of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God,</hi> by the miniſtery of his Apoſtles and Miniſters, in the preaching of the word.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing to be conſidered is, the dignity or prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue it ſelfe, expreſſed in theſe words; <hi>Yee are the ſonnes of the liuing God.</hi> Where we are to note, that he doth not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue a perfect antitheſis betweene theſe and the former words, which ſhould haue bin thus expreſſed; <hi>In the place where it was ſaid, yee are not my people, it ſhall be ſaid vnto them, ye are the people of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but in ſtead thereof, he ſaith; <hi>ye are the ſonnes of the liuing God.</hi> The reaſon whereof is this: firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would hereby ſignifie, that through Chriſt in the couenant of grace, we haue a far more excellent eſtate then vnder the law by the couenant of works; for then they were but the people or ſubiects of God, but now they are his ſons adopted in Ieſus Chriſt, and <hi>being ſonnes, they are likewiſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>heires and coheires with Chriſt:</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, Rom. 8. 17. Then they were the people of God on the condition of their perfect obedience to the Law; which when they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued not, they loſt this dignity, and were reiected from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods people; but now they are ſonnes on the condition of faith, and heires of an <hi>inheritance immortall, vndefiled, and that fadeth not away;</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 1. Pet. 1. 4. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4.</note> they ſhall neuer fall from the couenant, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake, or be forſaken of God, ſeeing <hi>his ſeed remaineth in them.</hi> 1. Iohn 3. 9. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 9.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, by this phraſe he excludeth in the worke of our ſaluation, all kind of merit, and ſheweth that it is wholly to be aſcribed to the free grace of God. If he had ſaid, <hi>ye ſhall be</hi>

               <p>Thirdly, we learne what is the inſtrument and means, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note place="margin">The miniſtery of the word, the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our adoption.</note> we become the ſons of God; not by our own works, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing which we could do, but by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſtery of the word, and preaching of the Goſpel, which being made effectual by the inward operation of Gods ſpirit, begetteth true faith, whereby we lay hold vpon Chriſt, and are ingrafted into his myſtical body, and ſo in him who is the naturall ſon of God we become the ſons of God by adoption &amp; grace. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration wherof ſhould moue vs highly to eſteem this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious pearle, and with all care and conſcience to receiue and lay it vp in our hearts, ſeeing it is the only ordinarie meanes whereby we become the adopted ſons of God, and heires of euerlaſting life. If therfore we highly value the means of our worldly aduancement to ſome momentany patrimony, how ſhould we eſteeme of the preaching of the Goſpell, which intitleth vs to this dignitie of being the ſonnes of the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuing God, and heires of his glorious kingdome? And if this eſtimate were made by all, then would neither the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for ſmall occaſions refraine from hearing the word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched; neither would the Miniſters of the Goſpell for their worldly eaſe and pleaſure, liue idly and vnprofitable in their Miniſterie; nor for any inconueniences (ſinne onely excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) leaue their callings, and deſiſt from preaching Chriſt crucified, ſeeing it is the onely ordinarie meanes of the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of ſoules, and of adopting men to be the children of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we may obſerue, vnto what dignitie and high degree of excellencie we are exalted in the new couenant,

And for this purpoſe he ſcattereth them amongſt the Gentiles, that by occaſion of calling them vnto the kingdome of Chriſt, by whom the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael were to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, he might with them call the Gentiles like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: for the Iſraelites by a certaine right, in regard of Gods promiſes, made to their forefathers, were to haue the firſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Gods mercies, and in the firſt place to bee called into the couenant of grace; and therefore God in his infinite wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and mercie, ſcattereth them amongſt all nations, that vpon the occaſion of their calling, hee might call the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles together with them.</p>
               <p>Whereby the infinitneſſe of Gods bountie, and his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable <note place="margin">Gods mercy in iudgement.</note> wiſedome appeareth: hee executeth his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that he may inlarge his mercies, hee abaſeth his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that he may exalt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to higher dignitie, he diminiſheth the number of his Church, that hee may the more increaſe their multitude; and like the good husbandman, he ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his ſeed, the naturall ſons of <hi>Iacob,</hi> ouer the face of the whole earth, that they may multiplie and returne vnto him
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:10737:63"/> with great increaſe, the Gentiles being added vnto them. He ſhutteth them out of the couenant of works, that he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them into the couenant of grace, and denieth them to be his people and ſeruants, that he may make them his ſons and heires. In a word, he ſhutteth all both Iewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles in vnbeleefe, and in the ſtate of condemnation, that hee may haue mercie on all, and deriue vnto them eternall ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Rom. 11. 32.

               <p>And this is Gods vſuall courſe in all his iudgements to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his ſeruants: ſo hee ſuffered <hi>Adam</hi> to fall into ſinne, that hee might haue more ample occaſion of ſhewing his mercie; he baniſhed him out of the the earthly paradiſe, that he might receiue him into the kingdome of glorie; hee pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him and his poſteritie with a temporarie death, that it might be an entrance into eternall life; hee ſubiecteth their bodies to weakeneſſe and corruption, that they may riſe in power incorruptible and immortall; he laieth vpon them light and momentarie afflictions, that they may cauſe vnto them a ſuperexcellent and eternall waight of glorie, as it is 2.

The conſideration whereof ſhould make vs <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17.</note> patiently to ſubmit our ſelues when wee are afflicted, vnto Gods good will and pleaſure, ſeeing his iudgements end in mercie, and ſeeing in reſpect of his infinite wiſedome and almightie power he can, and in reſpect of his loue and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly kindneſſe, hee will raiſe benefits out of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and make thoſe things turne to our good and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſaluation, which in their owne nature, ſeeme to bring deſtruction and vtter damnation: Heb. 12. 9. <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, as hereby we are put in mind of Gods mercie; ſo alſo of our owne dutie, namely, that being exalted to this high dignitie of being the ſonnes of God, we walke accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our high calling, and demeane our ſelues like Gods children: for as it is an vndecent thing, that one who is raiſed from baſe eſtate, or taken out of the gallies, and aduanced to be the adopted ſonne and heire of ſome great Monarch,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:10737:64"/> ſhould now behaue himſelfe according to his former baſe condition; ſo much more vncomly is it that one exalted to this high dignitie of being ſon &amp; heire to the King of kings, ſhould be haue himſelfe like a child of Satan and bondſlaue of ſinne, liuing as in former times in the blindneſſe of minde, peruerſeneſſe of will, vncleanneſſe of affections, and in the luſts of the Gentiles, in a baſe ſort ſuffering his minde to lie groueling on the earth, wallowing himſelf in the filthie pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of worldly vanities, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane time forgetting his high calling, whereunto he is aduanced to be the ſonne of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God. For honours ſhould change our manners, and as ſoone as we are aduanced to this high dignitie, we ſhould like <hi>Saul,</hi> haue another heart, and not ſuffer our ſelues any more to be ruled with our own baſe luſts and concupiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but being the ſonnes of God, wee ought to bee guided and directed wholly and only by his ſpirit: otherwiſe wee can haue no aſſurance that we are admitted to this glorious ſtate and condition; for they who alone are led by Gods ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are his ſonnes; as appeareth, Rom. 8. 14. <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>The laſt thing which wee are to conſider is the difference betweene the true God, and the falſe gods of the Gentiles, for he is the euerliuing Iehouah, whereas they are either without life, dead or mortall. The conſideration whereof may ſerue firſt to reſtraine vs from tranſgreſſing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of our God, ſeeing he euerliueth to take pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment on vs for our ſinnes; ſecondly, it is a ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to holy obedience, ſeeing our Lord and Maſter euerliueth to reward our ſeruice; and laſtly, it miniſtreth to all Gods children matter of ſweete conſolation, in that they haue a God in reſpect of his power almightie, in reſpect of his loue and good will alwaies readie, that euerliueth to giue vnto them the good things which they deſire, and to deliuer them from the euils which they feare; and as he hath life in himſelfe, ſo he will giue life vnto them, that together with him they may reigne in all happineſſe and eternall feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie in his kingdome.

               </p>
               <p>But let vs come to the words more particularly: where firſt is ſet downe their reunion into one Kingdome, who by diſcord and diſſenſion had been diſunited. The which is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by this phraſe of gathering together: for whereas the people of Iſrael and Iuda, had like ſheepe gone aſtray, and had diſperſed themſelues amongſt the Gentiles, as in a waſte wilderneſſe, the Lord promiſeth, that by the great Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of our ſoules, Ieſus Chriſt, they ſhould be recollected and gathered into one flocke and one ſheepfold.</p>
               <p>The parties then who being diſperſed, ſhould be gathered together, are the Iſraelites and the Iewes, where (as before) by Iſraelites, we are to vnderſtand the ſonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:10737:65"/> according to the Spirit: that is, all the faithfull and true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, both Iſraelites and Gentiles; and by Iuda, the people of the Iewes, who alſo belonged to Gods election, and were indued with the faith of <hi>Abraham;</hi> neither were all the Iewes, according to the fleſh, added vnto Chriſts Kingdome, but onely the true Iewes, who were children of the promiſe: for as the Apoſtle ſaith; <hi>All are not Iſrael which were of Iſrael;</hi> Rom. 9. 6. ſo he ſaith; <hi>he is not a Iew which is one outward, but hee is a Iew wihch is one within:</hi> Romans 2. 28, 29. ſo <note place="margin">

               <p>Now the order of their gathering together, may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued out of the order of the words; for the Iewes haue the firſt place, becauſe they were ſtill the Church and people of God, and were not reiected out of Gods couenant, but were as yet in &amp; about the ſheepfold; as appeareth, Luk. 1. 68. &amp; 7. 16. and then the Iſraelites, who by a certaine kind of right, in regard of Gods promiſes, made to their forefathers were to be gathered together, and added to the Church: and laſtly, the Gentiles, who by occaſion of their calling, were together called with them; as appeareth, Rom. 1. 16.</p>
               <p>The time when they ſhould be gathered, was not preſent, but to come; and this is ſignified by the future tenſe here v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: that is, not in the time of the Law, but of the Goſpell, when the true Meſſias ſhould be exhibited.</p>
               <p>The perſon by whom this vnion ſhould be made, was not themſelues, who rather were ready more and more to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and go aſtray, but Ieſus Chriſt their great and onely true ſhepheard: and therefore he ſaith, not that they ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble themſelues; but that they ſhould be gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, namely by another; that is, Chriſt: ſo Eſai. 11. 12. <hi>Hee ſhall ſet vp a ſigne to the Nations, and aſſemble the disper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi>

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:10737:65"/> vnto God, and made his Church and family. For he therefore died, that by his death he might <hi>gather together in one the children of God, which were ſcattered:</hi> Iohn 11. 52. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. 52.</note> And Chriſt ſaith; that <hi>if he were lift vp from the earth</hi> (that is, crucified) <hi>he would draw all men vnto him:</hi> ſo Eph. 2. 13. <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>The meanes are either externall or internall. Externall, the preaching of the Goſpell, whereby we are called to the knowledge of Chriſt, and the myſtery of our redemption wrought by him. Eph. 4. 11, 12. <hi>He therefore gaue ſome to be Apostles, and ſome Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for the gathering together of</hi>

                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 11, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>the Saints.</hi> Internall on Chriſts part, is his holy Spirit; on our part a true and liuely faith, whereby we all are vnited vnto Chriſt our head, and one with another, as fellow members of the ſame body.</p>
               <p>The manner of this collection is either ſpirituall, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and locall: the ſpirituall vnion or gathering together, is the communion of all the Saints, when as they are vnited and knit together in one myſticall body, <hi>in one ſpirit, in one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptiſme, one God and Father;</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, Eph. 4. 4, 5, 6. And this vnion and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 4, 5, 6.</note> is not hindered by diſtance of place, ſeeing the ſpirit of God, which is the bond of this vnion, filleth all places, and vniteth the faithfull of all countries and nations into one body, whereof Chriſt is the head. And this collection is here principally vnderſtood.</p>
               <p>The other is corporall and locall; when as the Saints of God vnited in that ſpirituall vnion, are alſo gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame place, country, and congregation; the which of all the faithfull is exceedingly to be deſired, for the mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all comfort and edification one of another, which commeth vnto all them, who being vnited by the ſame ſpirit and faith, are alſo knit together in the ſame company and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe. <label type="milestone">

               </p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of theſe words. The doctrines which ariſe from them, are theſe. Firſt, whereas the promiſes <note place="margin">That we ought not to maligne the people of the Iewes.</note> of God, concerning the gathering together of his Church, are made both to the Iewes, Iſraelites, and Gentiles; and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:10737:66"/> the Iewes in the firſt place. Hence we learne to lay aſide that antient enmity which is in worldly men towards that Nation, and to loue thoſe which are conuerted to the faith as brethren; and likewiſe to pray for thoſe which are not yet called, that they may be added to the Church. The malice of men towards this nation hath bin ſuch, that it is growne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a prouerbiall ſpeech; <hi>to hate one as they hate a Iew:</hi> the which, howſoeuer it is a iuſt iudgement of God vpon the Iewes, for their obſtinacy in their infidelity and vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; yet it is a ſinne in them, ſeeing this people haue in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers reſpects deſerued well at our hands; in that they were for a long time together, faithfull treaſurers of Gods diuine oracles, the Law and Prophets; in that they were our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church, vnto which wee were added, from whom we haue receiued our light and knowledge; and in that <hi>by their fall, ſaluation is come vnto vs Gentiles:</hi> Rom. 11. 11. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 11.</note> let vs not boaſt our ſelues againſt the naturall branches, who were branches of the wild Oliue tree. For if God ſpared not them, let vs take heede leſt he alſo ſpare not vs: Rom. 11. 21. Yea, but will ſome ſay, they crucified the Lord of life, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 21.</note> and therefore deſerue to be hated of all. I anſwer, that we are rather to turne the edge of this hatred againſt our owne ſinnes, which were the principall cauſe of Chriſts death, whereof they were but inſtruments, and as it were our execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners. Beſides, God in his exceeding mercy and goodneſſe, hath turned this their cruell fact to our exceeding good, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the redemption and ſaluation of our bodies and ſoules: and therefore if this were a ſufficient cauſe to appeaſe <hi>Ioſephs</hi> anger towards his brethren, becauſe God turned their malice to all their good, euen the aduancement of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 50. 20.</note> and preſetuation of their whole family: then ſurely the like reaſon ſhould pacifie our wrath towards our elder bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren the Iewes, ſeeing God hath in his infinite goodneſſe made their hatred and rage, a meanes of our redemption and eternall ſaluation, by Chriſts death and bloodſhed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we here obſerue, who is the chiefe and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall <note place="margin">Chriſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs into the Church.</note> cauſe of our gathering together into the Church; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:10737:66"/> our Sauiour Chriſt; for we were like wandring ſheep gone aſtray in the wilderneſſe of the world, continually vnder the power, and at the command of the ſpirituall wolfe Satan, who at pleaſure might pray vpon vs, notwithſtanding any reſiſtance we were able to make: out of which dangers we could by no meanes quit our ſelues, ſeeing the eyes of our mindes were ſo blinded with ignorance, that we could not finde the way to our ſheepfold, the Church of God, where onely is ſafety and ſecurity; nay rather we were ready more and more to wander and loſe our ſelues in the Labyrinth of our owne errors; and though we had got ſome ſmal glimpſe of the right way, yet we were ſo intangled in the brires of our ſinnes and corruptions, that we could not haue trauailed in it. And in this fearefull condition we remained, till Chriſt our good ſhepheard came to ſeeke vs, and hauing found vs, carried vs on his ſhoulders into his ſheepfold of grace and happineſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we are to obſerue the meanes whereby Chriſt <note place="margin">Chriſts blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, the meanes of our gathering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the church.</note> gathered vs into his Church; namely, by ſhedding his blood: for ſinne which excluded vs out of it, and ſcattered vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, could not be done away, but by Chriſts death, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Gods iuſtice was to be ſatisfied, and his wrath appeaſed. The conſideration whereof, as it ſhould make vs moſt thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to our good ſhepheard Chriſt, who hath not ſpared to giue his life for his ſheepe; ſo it ſhould make vs moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to walke in the waies of Gods Commandements, and to auoid the by-paths of errour and ſinne; leſt after we are gathered together, and brought into Chriſts fold, we wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der againe and goe aſtray, and ſo fall into the iawes of the ſpirituall wolfe, who daily ſeeketh to deuoure vs. For if we neglect the paines and labour, yea the loſſe of the pretious blood of our good ſhepheard, which he ſpilt in ſeeking vs, that he might free vs from danger, and bring vs ſafe to his ſheepfold, and ſuffer our ſelues to be allured with euery vaine triffle, to leaue his flocke, and to wander in the deſerts of the wicked world, till we are againe loſt and ſubiect to the former dangers from which he freed vs: let vs take heede
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:10737:67"/> leſt he alſo baſely account of vs, as being vnworthie of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond labour in ſeeking of vs.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we are to obſerue, that the meanes whereby hee <note place="margin">The miniſtrie of the word the meanes of applying Chriſts bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits vnto vs. <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 27.</note> applieth the former benefit vnto vs, making it effectual for our gathering into his Church, is the miniſterie of his word, his holy ſpirit, and a liuely faith; and therefore wee are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and conſcionablie to heare Gods word, which is the voyce of our ſhepheard, whereby hee gathereth vs into his ſheepefold. And foraſmuch as wee are dull of hearing, and ſlow in comming, both in reſpect of the ſtiffeneſſe of our limmes, and ſtubbornneſſe of our willes; therefore let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually implore our good ſhepheard, not onely to call vs with his voice, but alſo to ſend his holy ſpirit to aſſiſt vs; for he alone openeth our deafe eares, ſuppleth our ſtiffe ioynts, and mollifieth and inclineth our ſtubborne willes, making vs both able and willing to come vnto him, when he in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie of the word calleth vs. And ſeeing wee alſo before we can come vnto Chriſt, muſt be indued with a liuely faith; therefore let vs vſe all good meanes ordained of God, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto it, and not ceaſe begging of it at the hands of our heauenly father, ſeeing it is not of our ſelues, but wee haue it onely by his free gift, as appeareth, Eph. 2. 8. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 8. Gods ſpirit the bond of our vnion with Chriſt and one with another.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, we are to obſerue, that this collection of Gods people is ſpirituall, becauſe the ſpirit of God is the bond of this communion, which is amongſt the ſaints; and therefore it cannot be hindred by diſtance of place, becauſe the ſpirit of God filleth all places in heauen and earth. The which ſerueth notablie for our comfort, in that we haue by vertue of this ſpiritual and inſeparable vnion, part with al the ſaints in al their faſtings, prayers, &amp; al good exerciſes, and holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Gods worſhip and ſeruice, though we ſhould bee exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into the vttermoſt parts of the world, becauſe we are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited vnto them by the ſame ſpirit.</p>
               <p>But beſides this ſpirituall communion, there is alſo a local <note place="margin">That there ought to be a locall gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring together of the Church</note> and corporal gathering together in the ſame viſible Church and congregation; which as much as in them lieth is to bee deſired and attained vnto of all the faithfull; for they are the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:10737:67"/> ſheepe of Ieſus Chriſt, and therfore they are not wild beaſts to be ſcattered and ſingled euery one from another in his owne denne, but to flocke together in their owne ſheepfold, that they may ioyntly performe ſeruice to the great ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, in hearing his word, receiuing his Sacraments, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for thoſe things they want, and prayſing him for thoſe good things which they haue receiued: that alſo by this outward collection of their bodies, they may teſtifie the the inward coniunction of their minds and ſoules; and not only teſtifie, but alſo confirme and increaſe it, by perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming all mutuall duties one to another, as inſtructing the ignorant, helping the diſtreſſed, relieuing the poore, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe that mourne, defending the weake, and exhorting one another to all holy actions of pietie and righteouſneſſe. Neither muſt they conſort themſelues with wolues, goates, beares and ſuch wild beaſts; that is, with worldly and wicked men, who either will ſeduce, or elſe deſtroy them; ſeeing it is the nature of the true ſheepe of Chriſt to flocke together, and to ſequeſter themſelues from all other companie, as much as they can in this worldlie wilderneſſe, wherein often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times neceſſitie, and not choice intermingleth thoſe which ſhould be ſeuered.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the vnitie of the faithfull. The ſecond <note place="margin">The vnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the faithfull.</note> thing expreſſed, is their vnanimitie, which appeareth in their ioynt conſent, and generall agreement in the choice of their head and gouernour. For after they are called by God, and gathered together into the Church and kingdome of Chriſt, then being thus choſen to bee Chriſts people and ſubiects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they likewiſe make choice of him to be their king and head, And this is ſignified in theſe words: <hi>And ſhall appoint</hi> (or as the decorum of the matter requireth, &amp; the words may well beare) <hi>chooſe, or ſet ouer themſelues one head, that is, one king, and ſupreme gouernour, namely, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> For he alone is the great King of his people, the great ſhepheard of his flocke, the head of his members, which is his Church, as appeareth in many places of the Scripture: So Ezech. 34. 23. 24. 37. 22. 23. 24. Ioh. 10. 16. 1. Cor. 11. 3. Epheſ. 1. 22. 5. 23.</p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:10737:68"/>
               <p> But here it may be demanded, how this here is aſcribed <note place="margin">

Epheſ. 1. 22. To which I anſwere, that God the father firſt and principally doth appoint Chriſt head and king ouer the Church; and the people of God do ſet Chriſt ouer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, when as they giue their mutuall aſſent to Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and by a liuely faith receiue Ieſus Chriſt for their king and head, promiſing vnto him their alleageance and obedience. Thus <hi>Saul</hi> was appointed and annointed King ouer Iſrael by God, 1. Sam, 10. 1. And the people alſo <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 1. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 15.</note> are ſaid to haue made him king ouer them in <hi>Gilgal:</hi> 1. Sam. 11. 15. So that it is not enough, that Chriſt ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God to be our king and head, vnleſſe we receiue him for our ſoueraigne, yeelding vnto him our faith and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: which if we neglect, notwithſtanding God hath appointed him king and head ouer his Church, yet he is not ſo vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Now the Church receiueth Chriſt to bee their king: firſt, <note place="margin">The Church receiueth Chriſt for their king by faith.</note> when as with free conſent of will and by a liuely ſaith, they doe acknowledge and imbrace him alone, for their king, head and Sauiour, reſting wholly vpon him, and vpon no other whatſoeuer for their protection, preſeruation, redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſaluation; promiſing and vowing vnto him alone their alleageance and obedience, as being their onely Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne. For by true faith wee are ioyned and vnited vnto Chriſt, as ſubiects to their king, and members to their head, and when wee doe beleeue in him, wee doe as it were with our ſuffrages and voices, chooſe and imbrace him for our king and head.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, when as beleeuing this in their minde and heart, they are readie with their tongues openly before men, to make confeſſion and profeſſion thereof; aſſembling <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 10.</note> themſelues as his ſubiects in the publike congregation to worſhip and ſerue him their Lord and king, in hearing his worde, calling on his name, and receiuing his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:10737:68"/>
               <p> He further ſaith; <hi>that they ſhall ſet ouer themſelues a head.</hi> Whereby he ſignifieth, one ſhould not chooſe a head for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but euery man for his owne ſelfe. For as the <hi>iuſt ſhall</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Habac.</hi> 2. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>liue by his owne faith,</hi> and not by another mans: ſo by his owne faith, and not anothers, hee receiueth and imbraceth Chriſt for his King, head and Sauiour.</p>
               <p>But what then ſhall wee thinke of infants, who haue not <note place="margin">How infants come to haue part in Chriſt. <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 14. 16.</note> actuall faith; are they therefore deferred from hauing Chriſt their head and Sauiour? I anſwere no; for Chriſt bleſſeth and prayeth for them, affirming that the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen belongeth vnto them. And the promiſes of God are made not only to the faithfull, but vnto their ſeede alſo: Gen. 17. 7. Act. 2. 39. in all which they could haue no part, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 7. <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 39.</note> vnleſſe they were vnited vnto Chriſt, in whom alone is ſaluation. What then, are they ſaued by the faith of the Church, or of their parents? I anſwere, no, for euery man liueth by his owne faith: vnleſſe wee vnderſtand it thus; that the Church or their parents, grounding their faith vpon the promiſes of God made to the faithfull and to their ſeede, doe by their prayers obtaine faith, or the ſeede and ſpirit of faith, for their children, whereby they liue. Neither muſt wee imagine, that they haue actuall faith, before which goeth illumination, and knowledge of Gods promiſes made in Chriſt, which the beleeuer applieth vnto himſelfe; ſeeing then they ſhould loſe it againe before they come to age, which is not incident vnto true faith, which once had is neuer loſt. But wee are to know, that the ordinarie courſe of vniting them to Chriſt by faith, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing to their age, which is not capable therof, God vſeth extraordinarie meanes, ſupplying all things needfull for this worke, by the inward operation of his holy Spirit, whereby he regenerateth and ſanctifieth them, as hee did <hi>Ieremie</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt in their mothers wombe, as appeareth Iere. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ier.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 15.</note> 1. 5. Luk. 1. 15. and vniteth them vnto Chriſt their head, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the chiefe bond of this vnion, and ſo being members of his bodie, they haue part in the righteouſneſſe and merits of Chriſt their head, whereby they are iuſtified and ſaued.</p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:10737:69"/>
               <p> Furthermore, ſpeaking of the Kingdome of Chriſt ouer <note place="margin">Chriſt the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly head of the Church.</note> his Church, he doth not ſay, that they ſhould ſet him ouer them for their King, but for their head; which he purpoſely doth, to ſhew the neere vnion that is betweene Chriſt and his Church; for there is a far more neere coniunction and vnion betweene the head and the body, then is or can be betweene the King and his ſubiects.</p>
               <p>Now this ſo agreeth to Chriſt to be the head of his church, as that it agreeth to no other beſides him; for it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that the head of the church ſhould be both God and man: for if he had bin God alone, there could haue bin no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, and conſequently, no communion betweene the head &amp; the members; if man alone, he could not haue quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his body, which was dead in ſinne, nor offered to God the Father a ſufficient price for the redemption thereof, nor vanquiſhed the ſpirituall enemies of our ſaluation, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, the world, ſinne, death, and the graue. It was neceſſary therefore that our head ſhould be of both the diuine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, that he might be vnited vnto vs, and vnite vs vnto God: and ſo as the Father is his head, ſo he might be head of his Church; as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 1. Cor. 11. 3. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt then alone is the head of the Church, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Pope doth falſly arrogate this title vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; for as the Church is but one body, ſo it hath but one head; otherwiſe it ſhould be a monſter. And this the Prophet here ſheweth, when as he ſaith, that they ſhould ſet ouer them one head, and not be like the Kingdome of Iſrael and Iuda, who were rent and diuided vnder the gouernment of two heads.</p>
               <p>Neither is Chriſt an idle head, who hath referred all the gouernment of his body the Church, to his viſible and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall head the Pope; but he is in euery reſpect a true head indeed: for he it is from whom we deriue our life, ſenſe, and motion, in all the actions of holineſſe and righteouſneſſe; he it is that quickeneth his body dead in ſinne; he it is that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uideth for it, and protecteth it from all dangers, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and power of all enemies; and he alſo it is who by the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:10737:69"/> ſcepter of his word, and the direction of his holy ſpirit, gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and gouerneth it; as he promiſed, Iohn 16. 13. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of the words. The doctrines <note place="margin">That God chuſeth vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we chuſe him.</note> which from hence ariſe are theſe. Firſt, out of the connexion of this with the former point, we learne, that we are firſt ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together by God into his Church, effectually called and choſen to be Gods people, before we chuſe Chriſt to be our King and head, or will ſubmit our ſelues to bee ruled by the ſcepter of his word and Spirit: whereby it appeareth, that we are not cauſes of this ſpirituall vnion with Chriſt, nor of thoſe royall dignities, and excellent benefits, which hereby are deriued vnto vs; but the free grace and mercy of God, which before we haue any deſire of attaining hereunto, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteth vs with his loue, calling and chuſing vs to this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and happy eſtate, when we had neither ability nor will to aſpire vnto it. God therefore did not chuſe vs for his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, becauſe firſt we made choice of him to be our King and head; but as the Apoſtle ſaith, of his loue, <hi>wee loued him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loued vs firſt:</hi> 1. Iohn 4. 19. ſo may we ſpeake of the <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 19.</note> fruits of his loue; we come vnto him, becauſe firſt he called vs; we chuſe him for our King and head, becauſe firſt he chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vs for his ſubiects and members; we ſubmit our ſelues to his gouernment, becauſe firſt he ruleth and ouer-ruleth vs by his ſpirit, with the inward working thereof inclining vs to holy obedience, who naturally are ſtubburne and rebellious: ſo that all our works and duties towards God, are but the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his gratious working in vs, and nothing but inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our motions of that firſt mouer, and as it were but reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe heauenly beames of Gods grace and goodneſſe which ſhine vpon vs.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing which we are to obſerue is, that as <note place="margin">That as ſoone as God hath choſen vs into his Church, we chuſe him.</note> ſoone as we are gathered into the Church, and choſen by Chriſt to be his ſubiects and members; then preſently doe we chuſe him to be our King and head, ſubmitting our ſelues to be ruled and gouerned by the ſcepter of his word and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit. For God doth not worke vpon vs as vpon ſtockes and ſtones, but as vpon reaſonable creatures, who being firſt
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:10737:70"/> ſet a worke by his holy Spirit, doe worke together with him. Whereby we may learne, whether God hath choſen vs and effectually called vs, to this high dignity of being the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt; not by entring into Gods ſecret counſels, but by deſcending into our ſelues, ſearching and examining our owne hearts, whether we haue made choyce of Chriſt to be our head and gouernour: for if we haue ſo done, then aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly he hath called and choſen vs, ſeeing our chuſing of him to be our head, is but an effect of his chuſing of vs to be his members. Now further wee may know, whether in deede and truth we haue choſen Chriſt to be our head, by exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our owne hearts, whether we haue ſubmitted our ſelues to be guided and directed by his holy Spirit. Which if we haue not done, then certainely whatſoeuer we profeſſe, we haue not choſen Chriſt to be our head, and conſequently, we can haue no aſſurance, that we are choſen by Chriſt, to be the members of his body.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we are to obſerue, that the Church doth not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after a generall manner, ſet ouer them Chriſt to be their <note place="margin">Euery true member of Chriſt appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him vnto himſelfe by his own faith.</note> head; but euery member thereof doth particularly make choice of him to himſelfe: whereby we learne, that neither the faith of the Church, nor the faith of our parents is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make vs true members of Chriſts body, vnleſſe we particularly appropriate him vnto our ſelues by our owne faith; for as no man is rich, wife, or learned by the riches, wiſedome or learning of another man, but by his owne; ſo is no man faithfull by anothers faith, vnleſſe himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue. The conſideration whereof, ſhould make vs not to content our ſelues to be reckoned outward members of a faithfull congregation, or to be the children of moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and religious parents; ſeeing euery man is vnited vnto Chriſt, iuſtified and ſaued by his owne faith, and not another mans; and therefore euery one is earneſtly to labour by all meanes to attaine vnto this gift of God, that he may not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay generally with the Church, we beleeue, but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, I beleeue, as in the Creed alſo we profeſſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, as euery one is to chooſe a head vnto himſelfe,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:10737:70"/> ſo but one onely head Ieſus Chriſt, ſeeing a body with two or many heads, is of all eſteemed monſtrous. And therefore <note place="margin">That the Pope is to be renounced.</note> wee are to renounce the Pope from being our head, and to keepe vs to our onely head Ieſus Chriſt, ſubmitting our ſelues wholly and onely to be guided and directed by his word and holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we are to obſerue what kind of head our Sauiour <note place="margin">Chriſt is our head in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of all perfection.</note> Chriſt is vnto vs, not an idle head, or in title onely; but ſuch a one as in deed and truth hath in him the nature and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a head, in the higheſt degree of all perfection. For he is ſuch a head as intirely loueth vs, as being the members of his owne body; he is an almighty and moſt powerfull head, who is able to protect and defend vs from all dangers and malice of enemies; he is a moſt vigilant and prouident head, who obſerueth all our wants, and by his al-ruling proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, prouideth for vs: and finally, he is a moſt wiſe head, to gouerne and guide vs in all our waies, not onely illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vs, and giuing vs ſight to diſcerne which is the beſt courſe; but alſo deriuing vnto vs ſtrength and motion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are inabled to walke in it. And therefore ſeeing wee haue a head ſo abſolute and perfect in the higheſt degree of all excellency; let vs take heede that we make not choice of any other, nor of our ſelues to be our head, but renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all other, keepe vs wholly and onely vnto him. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is a moſt louing head, let vs reioyce in his loue, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne loue vnto him againe: and as the arme offereth it ſelfe to be cut off, rather then the head ſhould be wounded; ſo let vs, who are the members of Chriſts body, be ready to indure blowes, wounds, yea death it ſelfe, rather then any wound of diſhonour ſhould be inflicted on our head Chriſt. And ſeeing he is an almighty head, let vs truſt wholy in his power, reſting and relying vpon him alone for deliuerance out of the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of all dangers, and from the raging violence of all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and ſeeing he is our carefull and moſt prouident head, let vs not reſt ſo much vpon our owne prouiſion, induſtry and labour, which will often faile vs, as vpon his al-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, al-ſeeing, and al-ruling prouidence, who knoweth all
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:10737:71"/> our wants, better then we our ſelues, and neuer faileth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in will or power to ſupplie them. And laſtly, ſeeing hee is ſuch a head as is infinite in wiſedome, and all knowledge, let vs ſubmit our ſelues wholly and onely, to be inſtructed, gouerned and guided by him; not following others directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and traditions, nor our owne inuentions. For hee is <hi>the light of the world, and he that followeth him, ſhall not walke in darkeneſſe, but ſhall haue the light of life:</hi> Ioh. 8. 12. Which <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 8. 12. 12. 35.</note> light being taken away, there remaineth nothing but palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble darkeneſſe, Ioh. 12. 35. He is his fathers dearely beloued ſon, whom we muſt heare, Mat. 17. 5. He is our onlie maſter and teacher, of whom we muſt be inſtructed, Matth. 23. 8. 10. In a word, he is our only head, and therefore as the members <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 17. 5. <hi>&amp;</hi> 23. 8. 10.</note> doe not guide, direct and gouerne themſelues, but ſubmit themſelues to be guided and directed by their head; ſo muſt we not direct and rule our ſelues by our owne wiſedome, but wholly giue ouer our ſelues to bee lead and ruled by him. And this is liuely ſet downe by the Apoſtle, 1. Cor. 11. 3. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt is the head of euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the man is the womans head; and God is Christs head.</hi> That is, as Chriſt did nothing of himſelfe, but by the counſaile and direction of his father, ſo ought euery man to do nothing by his owne wiſedome and direction, but as he is guided and ruled by Chriſt his head; and ſo likewiſe the woman is to follow the direction and counſaile of her husband, who behaueth himſelfe towards her, as Chriſt to his Church, and not her owne conceit. And if we thus giue our ſelues to be ruled and directed by Chriſt <note place="margin">Chriſt is our onely wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</note> our head, and abandone our own wiſdome, we thus becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fooles in our ſelues, ſhall be wiſe in Chriſt: 1. Cor. 3. 18. Whereas contrariwiſe, if wee will not ſubmit our ſelues to <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18.</note> be guided and gouerned by Chriſt, but follow our owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, and be directed by our own wiſedom, then though we be neuer ſo wiſe in the world, we ſhall be infatuated, and whileſt we labour to be wiſe in ſhew, we ſhal become fooles in truth: Rom. 1. 21. 22. As therefore without the direction <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21. 22.</note> and gouernment of the head, all the members are out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and performe their functions and actions amiſſe, the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:10737:71"/> foote ſtumbleth, the tongue balleth out follies, the hand faileth in all actions; ſo if wee bee not guided by Chriſt our head, we ſhall ſtumble and fall into all errours, hereſies and ſinnes; when we thinke to ſpeake moſt wiſely, wee ſhall but blurt out our owne follies; when we purpoſe to performe glorious and good actions, wee ſhall doe ſuch things as in themſelues are wicked, or after ſo ill a manner, and for ſuch ill ends, as that our actions which we deeme beſt, ſhall be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and diſpleaſing in the ſight of God.</p>
               <p>And ſo much concerning the vnitie, and vnanimitie of the Church. The fourth point expreſſed, is the libertie thereof out of their captiuitie; in theſe words: <hi>And they ſhall come vp out of the land,</hi> or, <hi>They ſhall aſcend from the earth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Some expound theſe words of the libertie of the Iewes <note place="margin">Expoſition.</note> and Iſraelites out of their corporall captiuitie, and of their returne into the land of Canaan out of Aſſyria and Babylon. But this interpretation cannot ſtand, becauſe the Iſraelites neuer returned out of their captiuitie, as appeareth by the ſecond iudgement before threatned, verſ. 6. and alſo by the euent, as hiſtories beare witneſſe; neither is it here ſaid, that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Funccius com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 23.</note> they ſhall aſcend out of Chaldea, Aſſyria or Medea, or that they ſhall come vp to Iudea or Chanaan, but indefinitelie that they ſhall aſcend out of the land. Moreouer, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iuda came vp out of their captiuitie of Babylon, long before the comming of the Meſſias, whereas the Prophet here ſpeaketh of the comming vp of the people after his comming, by vertue of that vnion which ſhould be between them and their head: and therefore it cannot be vnderſtood of that corporall libertie and locall comming out of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</p>
               <p>Seeing then theſe words cannot be vnderſtood of a carnall and corporal libertie, &amp; deliuerance out of a worldly &amp; tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porarie captiuitie; it followeth neceſſarily that we expound them of ſpirituall libertie and deliuerance of the whole Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael of God, his Church and faithfull children, conſiſting of all nations, Iewes, Iſraelites, and Gentiles, out of the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:10737:72"/> ſeruitude and captiuitie of ſinne, Satan and the world, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by Ieſus Chriſt their Sauiour, and moſt perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
               <p>And this expoſition agreeth well with the context and <note place="margin">The freedome of the Iewes compared with our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by Chriſt.</note> circumſtances of the place: for hauing in the former words ſhewed, that the Church and faithfull people of God, belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to his eternall election, ſhould be effectually called, and being collected and gathered out of the world, ſhould be ioyned to the Church and kingdome of Chriſt, hee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging them for his ſubiects and members, and they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging him for their head and king; now hee ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that theſe who were thus effectually called, ſhould by their Sauiour Chriſt bee iuſtified, ſanctified, and in the end perfectly glorified. All which he ſignifieth by this phraſe of comming vp out of the land, wherein he alludeth to the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral &amp; local comming vp of the people of <hi>Iuda,</hi> out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> to <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> For as they were ſet at libertie out of the hands of their enemies, and came vp out of their captiuitie vnto the land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> ſo the faithfull being vnited to Chriſt, and hauing made choice of him to bee their king and head, are by him redeemed and ſet at libertie out of the hands of their ſpirituall enemies, and come out of the land of their captiuitie, and out of the dominion of their tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Lords, ſinne, Satan, the world and the fleſh, and ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into the ſpirituall Canaan, and new Ieruſalem, that is, firſt, into the kingdome of grace, and then into the kingdom of glorie, where they inioy the perfect libertie of the ſonnes of God.</p>
               <p>The land therefore out of which the Church and people of God aſcend, is the land of darkeneſſe, the kingdome of Satan, ſinne and the world; the place whereunto they aſcend, is the kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt, firſt the kingdome of grace, and then the kingdome of glorie; for as ſoone as Chriſt hath choſen his Church to be his ſubiects and members; and they haue choſen him to bee their king and head, then the will of their ſoueraigne is, that being elected his ſubiects, they
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:10737:72"/> ſhould no longer liue in the kingdome of ſinne and Satan, where they were captiues, but that they ſhould bee admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into his owne kingdome, that where hee their king is, there they his ſubiects ſhould bee alſo: as it is, Ioh. 17. 24. 12. 26. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 24. 12. 26.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now they are ſaid to aſcend out of the land, becauſe the kingdome of ſinne and Satan is worldlie, earthly and below; whereas the kingdome of Chriſt is ſpirituall, heauenly and aboue; and therefore they who will come vnto it, muſt not lie groueling vpon the earth, but muſt aſcend vnto it. And of this the earthly <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was a type, which was ſituated in a hie place; in regard whereof the children of <hi>Iuda,</hi> when they came out of the land of their captiuitie, were ſaid to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend out of the land. And to this the Prophet here alludeth, as alſo the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> Chap. 2. 2. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 2. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Church then, and people of God, after that they are redeemed and ſet at liberty by Chriſt, muſt not abide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the kingdome of darkeneſſe, but they muſt aſcend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdome of Chriſt, the kingdome of grace, where they are to liue like Gods ſubiects, and doe ſeruice to their Lord and Sauiour, who hath redeemed them to this purpoſe; <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20.</note> and then to the kingdome of glorie, where they ſhall receiue a rich reward for their ſeruice, euen a crowne of glorie, and euerlaſting happineſſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt then they muſt aſcend out of the kingdome of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, <note place="margin">Of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of the power of darkeneſſe by vocation and iuſtification.</note> ſinne and Satan, into the kingdome of grace: which is done firſt, when as Ieſus Chriſt hath effectually called them, gathered them into his Church, and vnited them vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, making them members of his owne body, by vertue of his holy ſpirit, and the fruit thereof a liuely faith. By which vnion they haue right and propriety vnto the righteouſnes, death and merits of Chriſt their head, whereby they are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified in the ſight of God: for the iuſtice of God being fullie ſatisfied by the death and merits of Chriſt, and the debt of our ſinnes being diſcharged, they are pardoned and done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and we being clothed with his righteouſneſſe and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:10737:73"/> obedience, are accepted and reputed of God as iuſt, and ſo reconciled vnto him, and adopted for his ſonnes in Chriſt. And this is the firſt kind of our aſcending out of the land and kingdome of darkeneſſe, when as we are freed and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered out of the power of Satan and ſinne, in reſpect both of the guilt and puniſhment thereof; ſo that now it cannot condemne vs, nor any longer detaine vs as priſoners vnder the arreſt of the law, in the priſon of death and vtter darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And of this aſcenſion the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, Epheſ. 2. 4. 5. 6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they aſcend out of the kingdom of ſin &amp; Satan, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 4. 5 6. Our cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of the power of ſinne by ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</note> into the kingdom of Chriſt, when as being vnited vnto him, they haue part in his death and reſurrection, by the vertue and power whereof ſinne is mortified in them, and they rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the death of ſinne, to holineſſe and newneſſe of life: ſo that now their harts and affections, their words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, their life and conuerſation is quite changed; for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as whileſt they liued in the land of darkeneſſe, vnder the kingdome of ſinne and Satan, they were wholly earthlie, carnall and diabolicall: now being aſcended out of the land into the kingdome of Chriſt, they are ſpirituall and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly: their heart and affections which in former times did lie groueling on the earth, minding nothing but world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and carnall things, are now mounted aloft, ſo that though their bodies be on the earth, yet their <hi>conuerſation is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, from whence they expect their Sauiour, the Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3. 20. And <hi>being riſen with Chriſt,</hi> they doe not <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20.</note> ſeeke thoſe things which are on the earth, but <hi>thoſe things which are aboue;</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, Col. 3. 1. And as <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1.</note> they riſe aloft in heart and affections, ſo alſo in words and actions, which are not as in former times carnall and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but ſpirituall and heauenly. Of this aſcenſion the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, Rom. 6. 4. 5. 6. And this is <hi>that firſt reſurrection,</hi> of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4. 5. 6.</note> which <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh, in which whoſoeuer haue their part <hi>are bleſſed, becauſe on ſuch the ſecond death hath no power:</hi> Apoc. 20. 6. <note place="margin">

               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:10737:73"/>
               <p> And thus the Church and people of God aſcend out of the land of darkeneſſe, and the kingdome of ſinne and Satan, firſt by their iuſtification, whereby they are freed from the imputation, guilt and puniſhment of ſinne, ſo that it cannot <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33. 34.</note> accuſe and condemne them; and ſecondly by their ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, when by vertue of Gods ſpirit dwelling in them, and applying vnto them the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, they doe by little and little ſubdue and mortifie the power of ſinne, ſo that it doth no longer reigne and rule in them as <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 12.</note> in former times; and hauing leſſened and abated the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doe begin to riſe from the death of ſinne to newneſſe of life, yeelding voluntarie obedience to Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>The ſecond manner of the Churches going vp, or aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <note place="margin">Of our aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of the land of darkeneſſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glorie.</note> out of the land of darkeneſſe, the kingdome of ſinne and Satan, is, when they aſcend into the kingdome of glorie; whereof there are three degrees; the firſt whereof is in this life, which is onely in hope, and in reſpect of the certaine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of their full and perfect deliuerance out of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of ſinne and Satan, and of their entrance into and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the kingdome of heauen. The which their hope and aſſurance is grounded vpon their vnion with Chriſt; for being aſſured that Chriſt their head, clothed with their fleſh is aſcended into heauen, they haue no leſſe aſſurance that they his members ſhall alſo aſcend thither, ſeeing the vnion betweene them is inſeparable. And this is that aſcenſion of which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, Epheſ. 2. 4. 5. Of which in reſpect <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 4. 5.</note> of the certaintie of faith, Gods people haue ſuch full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, that they are ſaid not onely to hope for it, but alreadie to haue entred into it, and to haue taken poſſeſſion of it, Ioh. <note place="margin">

               <p>The ſecond degree of their aſcenſion out of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of ſinne and Satan, into the kingdome of glorie, is at the time of their diſſolution, when their bodies reſting

                  </label> after Chriſt hath gathered his Church, and they being ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, <note place="margin">That as ſoone as we are vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt, we aſcend out of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> haue by a liuely faith choſen and imbraced him for their King and head, then preſently they aſcend out of the land of darkeneſſe, the Kingdome of ſinne and Satan; and that in reſpect both of their iuſtification, whereby their ſinnes being not imputed, they are freed from guilt and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and are accepted as righteous, being clothed with the righteouſneſſe of Ieſus Chriſt; and in reſpect of their ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, whereby they are freed from the power and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſinne; when as the Spirit of God dwelling in them,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:10737:74"/> applieth vnto them the vertue of Chriſts death and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, whereby their ſinnes are by little and little mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſubdued, and they raiſed from the death of ſinne, to holineſſe and newneſſe of life. Whoſoeuer therefore are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered into the Church, and haue choſen Chriſt for their head, they may bee aſſured that they are iuſtified in Gods ſight, and ſo freed from the guilt and puniſhment of their ſinnes; and alſo that they are ſanctified, and in ſome meaſure freed from the power and iuriſdiction of ſinne, ſo that it ſhall no longer raigne in their mortall bodies; for theſe goe inſeparably together, ſo that hauing one, we may be aſſured <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 12.</note> that we haue all the other, and that wanting one, we want all the reſt.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we may obſerue, that the Church being ſet at liberty out of the land of darkeneſſe, doth aſcend into the <note place="margin">The true members of the Church are not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall but ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</note> Kingdome of God; firſt into the Kingdome of grace, and then into the Kingdome of glory. So that the Church of Chriſt, and all the true members thereof, are no longer earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, carnall, and worldly, but ſpirituall and heauenly; they are no more citizens of the world, but of the new Ieruſalem which is aboue; their hearts are not now groueling on the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20.</note> earth, but they haue their conuerſation in heauen, minding not earthly but heauenly things. For after that our Sauiour Chriſt our ſoueraigne Prince, hauing ouercome our ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all enemies, in whoſe bondage we were inthralled, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the ſentence of our liberty, we then begin to ſhake off the bolts and chaines of our ſinnes and corruptions, and to come out of the priſon and power of ſinne and Satan; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will we then make a ſtay there, but make all haſte poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to get out of their kingdome and dominion, leſt againe wee ſhould be ouertaken and inthralled in their bondage: and becauſe no other place can ſecure vs from this danger, therefore we aſcend into the kingdome of Chriſt, deſiring his aide and protection, who alone is able to defend vs: and foraſmuch as whileſt we continue in the ſuburbes of this kingdome the Church militant, although we be neuer ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:10737:75"/> yet we are continually aſſaulted with our ſpirituall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; therefore we continually deſire and hope to enter within the walles of the heauenly Ieruſalem, the Church triumphant in heauen; where not onely wee ſhall bee free from danger of being ſubdued, but alſo from aſſault and moleſtation: in the meane time, ſetling our minds and hearts not vpon things preſent, but vpon thoſe future ioyes, of which we are aſſured when we ſhall be admitted citizens of Gods kingdome of glory, and attaine vnto our full redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the ſteps and degrees whereby we aſcend out of the land of darkeneſſe, into the kingdome of glory, <note place="margin">The degrees whereby we muſt aſcend out of the land of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> the higheſt whereof none can attaine vnto, but they who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at the loweſt: for firſt we muſt be ſubiects of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of grace, before wee be ſubiects of the kingdome of glory; we muſt firſt be members of the Church militant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we be members of the Church triumphant; firſt wee muſt enter into the ſuburbes, before we can come into the citie; firſt we muſt haue aſſurance of our heauenly inheritance by faith and hope, before we ſhall inioy the actuall poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and laſtly, we muſt haue our mindes, hearts, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons tranſported into our heauenly country, or elſe our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies &amp; ſoules ſhall neuer aſcend thither. So that in this point alſo, one of theſe ſteps and degrees being aſcended, it giueth vs aſſurance that we ſhall ſtil aſcend till we come to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; and on the other ſide, if we begin not at the firſt, we ſhall neuer aſcend to the laſt, namely, the glorious ioyes of Gods kingdome.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing to be conſidered, is, by what vertue and power we aſcend out of the land of darkneſſe, into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome <note place="margin">By what ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and power we aſcend out of the land of darkeneſſe.</note> of glory; to wit, not our owne, but Ieſus Chriſts; for he alone is it, who by his death and merits, hath ſet vs free out of the land of darkneſſe, and deliuered vs from the guilt and puniſhment of our ſinnes; and he onely it is, who by vertue of his Spirit, applying his death and reſurrection vnto vs, doth enable vs to aſcend out of the power of ſinne, and to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:10737:75"/> ſubdue and mortifie the corruptions thereof. And none but he raiſeth vp our mindes from the earth and earthly things, and giuing vs entrance into his heauenly ioyes by faith and hope, doth tranſport our hearts and affections thither, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our ſoules and bodies ſhall afterwards aſcend. In a word, it is he alone, who by vertue of the ſame ſpirit, vniting vs vnto him as members of his body, doth cauſe vs to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend in ſoule at the houre of death, and in body and ſoule ioyned together at the general reſurrection, and giueth them full and actuall poſſeſſion of Gods kingdome. And therefore let vs beware, that we truſt not to aſcend vp into heauen by the broken ladder of the merits of Saints, or our owne works and worthineſſe, for ſo ſhall we rob Chriſt of his glory, and our ſelues of all comfort in this life, and happineſſe in the life to come: ſeeing theſe rotten and broken ſteps will moſt faile vs when we moſt reſt vpon them; but let vs looke to aſcend by Chriſt alone, who is the onely ſound and ſtrong ladder, vpon which the Angels deſcend to carry vs vp with them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome, Iohn 1. 51. and the true and ſtraight <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>And thus much concerning the deſcription of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches happineſſe, vnder the gouernment of Chriſt their head. In the laſt place, this their felicity is amplified in theſe words; <hi>for great is the day of Izreel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The which words by others are otherwiſe tranſlated and <note place="margin">The expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</note> expounded. Some reade them thus: <hi>When as the great day of Izreel ſhall be, or ſhall haue been:</hi> ſome thus; <hi>Although great ſhall be the day of Izreel.</hi> Both vnderſtanding by <hi>day of Izreel,</hi> the day of the calamitie of the people, when they were ouerthrowne in the valley of Izreel, and ſo led captiue by their enemies. According to which tranſlation, they make this to be the ſenſe of the place; that after this great deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the Lord would cauſe this great deliuerance; or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this great calamity ſhould certainely befall them,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:10737:76"/> yet this ſhould not hinder the performance of Gods promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, concerning the proſperous eſtate of the Church, vnder the gouernment of Chriſt their head.</p>
               <p>But as I take it, we are not to vnderſtand here by this great day of Izreel, the day of their great affliction and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, but the day of their great felicitie and happineſſe, not the day of their ouerthrow and captiuity, but of their reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and deliuerance out of their enemies hands: for in the fift verſe hee had ſpoken of this iudgement, and now hee ſpeaketh onely of mercie and deliuerance, whereby hee would comfort Gods people, who were deiected with the former threatnings: as appeareth by that both which went before, and that alſo which followeth.</p>
               <p>Now it is called <hi>the great day,</hi> becauſe it ſhould be a day wherein the Lord would ſhew the greatneſſe of his mercy, power, wiſedome, and goodneſſe, in the deliuerance of his people, and the deſtruction of their enemies: and becauſe it ſhould bee a day of great reioycing and triumph to the Church, when as they ſhould be gathered together vnder their head and King Ieſus Chriſt, and by him bee deliuered out of the land of darkeneſſe, and kingdome of Satan, where they were inthralled; and ſo aſcend into the Kingdome of God, the kingdome of grace firſt, and afterwards the kingdome of eternall glory. And it is called <hi>the day of Izre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> becauſe it is a day of their redemption and ſaluation: ſo Luk. 19. 41. 44. Where by <hi>Izreel</hi> wee are to vnderſtand the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 41. 44.</note> ſeed and ſonnes of God; not as in the fourth verſe, the ſeede which God would ſcatter and diſperſe, but which in the time of the great harueſt, he would reape and gather into his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of grace and glory.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of the wordes. The doctrine which from hence ariſeth is this. Here we may obſerue, what <note place="margin">What is the chiefe day of our reioycing.</note> we are to eſteeme the day of our great reioycing, and as it were our ſolemne feſtiuall; not wherein wee attaine ſome worldly riches, or temporary preferment, or wherein we are freed from ſome corporall calamitie, although in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:10737:76"/> we may lawfully reioyce in theſe reſpects: but the day of our ioy and triumph is, when as we are deliuered out of the bondage of Satan, and are gathered into the Church of God, and are ruled, protected, and gouerned by Chriſt our head, ſeeing in this day wee are freed from the greateſt euils, and aduanced to the greateſt dignities and preferments. And therefore let vs ſay with the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> vpon an other occaſion; <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made, let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce and be glad in it:</hi> Pſal. 118. 24. And that wee may ſhew <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118. 24.</note> and teſtifie this our ioy and gladneſſe, let vs ſolemnly aſſemble together to praiſe Gods name, and to render thanks to God, as for all other his benefites, ſo eſpecially for this great worke of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He argument of this chapter is like <note place="margin">The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> vnto the former; for herein the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iſrael are accuſed, and ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproued for their ſinnes of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, and vnthankfulneſſe towards God, and withall Gods fearefull iudgements are denounced, both againſt the whole Synagogue, and Church of Iſrael, and alſo againſt the particular members thereof. With which threatnings, leſt the faithfull and true children of God, ſhould bee too much amaſed and beaten downe with exceſſiue griefe, for the downefall of the Church; hee raiſeth them vp againe with ſound comfort, preaching vnto them the glad tidings of the Goſpell, wherein he foretelleth their reconciliation with God, the eſpouſals of the Church to her husband Ieſus Chriſt, and the manifold benefits which ſhould accompanie this happie contract.</p>
            <p>And this is the maine argument of this chapter. Out of <note place="margin">The analyſis.</note> which we may obſerue the parts thereof, which are two: firſt, legall threatnings: ſecondly, Euangelical promiſes. The firſt part beginneth, verſ. 2. and continueth to the 14. Wherein is ſet downe both their ſinne and puniſhment, and theſe are intermixed one with another. Their ſinne is twofold: firſt, their idolatrie: ſecondly, their ignorant ingratitude, which
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:10737:77"/> alſo conſiſteth of two branches: firſt, their aſcribing of all the benefits which they inioyed to their idols, verſ. 5. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, their not acknowledging God to be the author of them, verſ. 8.</p>
            <p>Their idolatrie is ſet downe in the 2. 3. 4. and 5. verſes. Wherin is contained, 1. a denunciation of a diuorce between God and the Church of Iſrael, verſ. 2. And the cauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, namely, her ſpirituall whoredomes, verſ. 5. The dinorce is firſt inioyned that it ſhould be denounced, and then the cauſes or ends of the denunciation are expreſſed; which are two: Firſt, that the Church of Iſrael taking notice of it, might lay it to heart, and be mooued thereby to repent of her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall whoredomes, verſ. 2. And ſecondly, that ſhe repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the Lord might not be mooued in his iuſt diſpleaſure to puniſh, neither her, verſ. 3. nor her children, verſ. 4.</p>
            <p>And this is the generall reſolution of this chapter. Now let vs come to the words themſelues. Verſ. 1. <hi>Say vnto your</hi>

               <hi>brethren, Ammi: and to your ſiſters, Ruchamah.</hi> In the laſt verſe <note place="margin">Expoſition.</note> of the former chapter, the Prophet had ſhewed that the faithfull which appertained to Gods election ſhould be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, &amp; ſhould ſet ouer themſelues one head Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; and ſo becomming ſubiects of his kingdome, and members of his bodie, ſhould by vertue of this vnion aſcend out of the kingdome of ſinne and ſatan, into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of grace and glorie: Now he exhorteth them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate one another, in reſpect of theſe great benefits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and with mutuall incouragements to ſtirre vp eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie man his neighbour and brother, that with a godlie care, and earneſt deſire and indeauour, and with a liuely faith they would receiue and applie to themſelues this grace of God and moſt mercifull benefits, which in Chriſt are offered vnto them; and not only ſo, but being themſelues made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of theſe ineſtimable benefits, he exhorteth them not to reſt contented with their owne happineſſe, but to labour, that it may be communicated to their brethren; and being eſcaped out of their miſerable ſeruitude into the glorious libertie of the ſonnes of God, he mooueth them to perſwade
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:10737:78"/> others, to participate of their freedome; and being conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the faith, and added to the Church themſelues, he ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them vp to labour for the conuerſion of others, and conſequently for the propagation of the Goſpell and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>So that (as I take it) this verſe is as it were an appendix or conſectarie vnto the two former, containing in it a dutie, which thoſe that were conuerted &amp; added vnto the Church, ought to performe to their neighbours and brethren, both according to the ſpirit, and alſo according to the fleſh; namely, that being themſelues aſcended out of the vallie of darkeneſſe into the mountaine of God, they ſhould by their exhortations and incouragements congratulate theſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits one with another, vpon whom they were beſtowed, and mooue others to aſcend with them. The which dutie the Prophets <hi>Eſay</hi> and <hi>Micha</hi> foretell ſhould be performed of the faithfull, in the time of the Goſpell, as appeareth, Eſa. 2. 2. 3. Mich. 4. 1. 2. And therefore ſeeing this verſe dependeth <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Eſa.</hi> 2. 2. 3. <hi>Mich.</hi> 4. 1. 2.</note> vpon the former, containing in it a conſequent dutie of thoſe gratious benefits, which through Chriſt, God beſtoweth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the faithfull, I thinke it may well bee referred and adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the former chapter.</p>
            <p>But let vs come to the words themſelues, wherein two things are to be conſidered: firſt, the parties to whom this dutie is inioyned: ſecondly, the dutie which by them is to bee performed. The parties who muſt ſpeake to their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, are thoſe of whom he had ſpoken in the former verſe, namely, ſuch as were gathered into the Church, vnited vnto Chriſt, and had aſcended out of the land of darkeneſſe into the kingdome of grace; they being aſcended themſelues muſt perſwade their brethren to aſcend with them. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our ſelues are called, vnited vnto Chriſt, iuſtified and ſanctified, we neither can nor wil exhort others to participate of theſe benefits, becauſe wee haue had no taſt nor feeling of them; nay, rather wee are readie to draw others from aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the mountaine of God, into the land of darkeneſſe, that together with vs they may haue the fruition of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:10737:78"/> of ſin, and wallow in the filthie puddle of worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightes, which we deeme the greateſt happineſſe, becauſe we haue had no ſenſe nor relliſh of better things. But when once our minds are inlightned, and wee diſcerne, that the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſinne are in themſelues baſe and vaine, and alſo in the end bring death and vtter deſtruction; and withall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the excellencie of Gods ſpirituall benefits, which hee beſtoweth vpon the faithful, and haue our ſelues attained vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome aſſurance of them; then doe wee not onely for our owne part contemne thoſe things which wee ſo highlie priſed in former times, but alſo perſwade others to ſcorne and loath them; then doe we not onely our ſelues inioy our heauenly happineſſe, but exhort others to congratulate our ioy, who alreadie are partakers of it, and to perſwade thoſe who haue not as yet taſted of it, that they will labour to attaine vnto it.</p>
            <p>The dutie which by theſe is to be performed, is, that they ſpeake vnto their brethren, that is, that they would exhort and ſtirre them vp, either to begin to aſcend into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, if they haue not yet aſcended; or if they haue, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate with them in this great happineſſe, and ſo with mutuall incouragements to moue one another with all care, alacritie and diligence, more and more to aſcend out of the land of darkeneſſe, and to adioyne themſelues more firmelie and neerely vnto the kingdome of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>In which dutie of exhortation and incouragement, we are to conſider two things: firſt, the perſons to whom it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and ſecondly the matter of the ſpeech it ſelfe. The perſons are their brethren and ſiſters, that is, all that belong to Gods election, whether they bee called alreadie, or to bee called; for theſe are to be exhorted that they aſcend, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be incouraged in their courſe, that with alacritie they may more and more aſcend. And becauſe none preciſelie knoweth who amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt thoſe who are not yet called belong to the election of God, therefore all our neighbors &amp; acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, are to bee exhorted and inuited that they would aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend with vs. And to this dutie we are bound by the law of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:10737:79"/> charitie, whether wee reſpect our loue towards God, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our neighbours; for our loue towards God bindeth vs to ſeeke the aduancement of his glory, by the inlarging of his kingdome; the which we doe, when as by our exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and holy example, we gaine men to Chriſt. Againe, we ought to loue our brethren as our ſelues; which if wee doe, then being eſcaped out of the kingdome of Satan, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into the Kingdome of God, we will vſe all our care and indeuour, that they likewiſe may bee deliuered and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend with vs. And this is done either when one priuate man doth exhort, perſwade, and incourage an other, both by word, and holy example of life, to become a true member of the Kingdome of Chriſt; or when Gods Miniſters by their publike preaching performe this duty; which is of all other meanes moſt effectuall, as being Gods owne ordinance, inſtituted for the gathering together of the Saints, and <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11. 22 <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16.</note> his ſtrong power vnto ſaluation to euery one that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth.</p>
            <p>But howſoeuer all men are to be inuited and exhorted to aſcend into the Kingdom of Chriſt, yet this is effectuall one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thoſe, who are indeed brethren and ſiſters: that is, ſuch as belong to Gods election, whether they be called or not called. Neither doth it hence follow, that becauſe others are called in the miniſtery of the word, <hi>Ammi</hi> and <hi>Ruchamah;</hi> that is, the people of God who haue obtained mercy; that the word of God ſhould be falſe, or they deluded; ſeeing there is no cauſe in the word, why indeed they ſhould not be the people of God, and partakers of his mercy, but in themſelues, namely, their owne infidelity: for if they would beleeue this ſpeech of the Goſpell, they ſhould in truth be Gods people; whereas not beleeuing, they loſe this title and dignity, and ſo as much as in them, giue God the lie; as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 1, Iohn 5. 10. But God is true of his word, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 10.</note> for the voyce of the Goſpell is generall and indefinite, and neuer particularly applied but by the faith of the hearer; and therefore being deliuered to a multitude, though many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect it, yet of ſome amongſt them it may be ſaid that they are
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:10737:79"/> the people of God; namely, thoſe who receiue it by a liuely faith.</p>
            <p>And ſo much for the perſons who are to be exhorted. The matter of the ſpeech which containeth in it the maine argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereby the exhortation is enforced, is in theſe two words, <hi>Ammi, Ruchamah:</hi> that is, <hi>ye are my people, ye haue obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mercy;</hi> or, <hi>O ye my people, O thou who haſt obtained mercie.</hi> The which is the voyce and glad tidings of the Goſpell, containing effectuall motiues, to moue all to aſcend into the kingdome of Chriſt, if they be not already aſcended; or more and more to aſcend, if they be already gone vp.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, thoſe that are the people and ſubiects of God, are not to dwell in the land of darkeneſſe, vnder the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſinne, Satan, and the world, but to aſcend into the kingdome of their owne King: but we are now become the people and ſubiects of God; for though in former times our ſinnes moued the Lord to reiect vs from being his people, and to exile vs out of his kingdome, ſuffering vs to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed as captiues in the land of darkeneſſe, and in the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of Satan; yet now Chriſt our head hath ſatisfied Gods iuſtice for our ſinnes, appeaſed his wrath, reconciled vs vnto him; ſo that now againe he is content to admit vs for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and ſubiects: and therefore let vs no longer abide in the land of darkeneſſe, and in the captiuity of Satan, from which Chriſt hath freed vs, but being deliuered and admitted Gods ſubiects and people, let vs now adioyne our ſelues vnto his kingdome, and obediently ſubmit our ſelues to his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment.</p>
            <p>So thoſe that haue already begun to aſcend, may be here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by moued more and more to goe forward in this courſe, and that both in reſpect of their faith, and in reſpect of their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; for if they be admitted the people of God, and haue obtained his mercy, why ſhould the huge waight of their ſinnes weigh them downe, and keepe them from aſcending in the aſſurance of faith, ſeeing God is gratious vnto his owne people and inheritance, and in his mercy hath done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all their ſinnes? and therefore, ſeeing they haue obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:10737:80"/> Gods infinite mercy, they haue a ſufficient medicine for their greateſt miſery.</p>
            <p>If they be the people of God, who haue obtained mercy, then may they bee moued hereby to aſcend in their affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, truſting in the prouidence of their al-ſufficient and moſt bountifull King; and not ſuffer their mindes to be tied vnto earthly meanes and ſecundary cauſes, preſuming in their abundance, and deſpairing in their want. If they bee Gods people, then may they aſcend in hope, that they ſhall, being his ſubiects, be admitted into his kingdome both of grace and glory, and be made partakers of the riches and royall benefits of them both, and not ſuffer tranſitory trifles to be the end and top of their hopes, ſeeing they are aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to higher dignities. Then alſo are they to aſcend in their feare; for if they be the people and ſubiects of God, then are they to feare the anger and diſpleaſure of their Soueraigne, as the greateſt euill; and in regard hereof, to be much more carefull and fearefull leſt they offend him, then any mortall man. And ſo likewiſe in their loue; for if they be Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who haue obtained mercy and aſſurance of Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, then what ſottiſh folly were it, to place their loue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the vanities of the world, which are of no value nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, and not rather on God, heauen and heauenly ioyes, which are moſt excellent and permanent?</p>
            <p>And this is the meaning of theſe wordes. The doctrines which from hence ariſe are diuers. Firſt, here we learne, that <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">The Do∣ctrines. </seg>
               </label> when we haue aſſurance of thoſe maine benefits, our effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <note place="margin">That wee ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in the fruition of Gods benefits.</note> calling and vnion with Chriſt, our redemption, iuſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſanctification, and eternall ſaluation, more to reioyce in them, then if we were made owners of the whole world: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt we ſmother this ioy in our ſelues, but with mutuall congratulations communicate it with our brethren. For this is a conſequent duty and effect of the former benefits recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; as appeareth in this place, as alſo Rom. 5. 1, 2, 3. To which <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1, 2, 3.</note> duty we ſhall eaſily be moued, if we often call to minde our paſſed miſery and preſent happineſſe. For if beggers when they attaine to great riches, bondmen when they are redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:10737:80"/> out of miſerable ſeruitude, and euery one who eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth out of deſperate &amp; deadly dangers, are euen ſo rauiſhed with ſuch tickling ioy, that their hearts, like too ſtrait and weake veſſels, would breake to containe it, vnleſſe they did vnburthen them by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municating them vnto others; then if we conſider our former beggerlineſſe and baſeneſſe, and our preſent honours and preſerments, our cruell and miſerable ſeruitude vnder ſinne and Satan in time paſt, and our glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and happy liberty, vnto which wee haue now attained; the great and mortall dangers of plagues and grieuous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, the anger of God, the curſe of the law, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death and condemnation; all which we haue fully eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, being not onely deliuered from the euill which we fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but poſſeſſed in the certainty of aſſurance, of ſuch happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that we could not hope for, nor ſo much as conceiue and wiſh for: how can our hearts containe ſuch rauiſhing ioyes? how can our tongues be ſilent, and not vnburthen our mindes, by congratulating them with thoſe who are made partakers of the like happineſſe? And if thus wee not onely ioy in our ſelues, but all reioyce with others, then ſhall wee hereby be ſtirred vp to praiſe the Lord, who is the chiefe and onely cauſe of all our ioy and happineſſe; and by this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſe of our thankfulneſſe, wee ſhall more and more confirme our aſſurance of the former benefits; for theſe are mutuall cauſes one of an other. Whereas contrariwiſe, our not praiſing God, argueth our little ioy, and our ſmall ioy our little aſſurance, and baſe eſteeme which we make of this vnſpeakeable happineſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, as we are to congratulate this our ioy with thoſe <note place="margin">That wee ought to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade others to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with vs in our ioy.</note> who are partakers of it; ſo are we by our perſwaſions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations to moue others who haue not yet taſted of it, that they labour to attaine vnto it; for this the law of charity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth at our hands, our loue towards God, which we mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt when as we labour for the aduancement of his glory in the inlarging of his kingdome; and our loue towards our neighbour, which is principally ſhewed in ſeeking their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion and eternall happineſſe. With which charity who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:10737:81"/> is indued, he cannot chuſe but performe this duty; for as the Sunne cannot keepe vnto it ſelfe his light, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth it to the good and comfort of other creatures; and as the wood which is kindled and inflamed, doth alſo kindle other wood which ioyneth vnto it: ſo they who are illuminated with the light of knowledge, cannot keepe it from ſhining vnto others; and thoſe who are inflamed with the zeale of Gods glory, and loue of their brethren, cannot chuſe but labour to make thoſe who are about them like vnto them, and partakers of thoſe benefites which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy. Examples hereof wee haue, Iohn 1. 41. 45. and chap. 4. 28, 29.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, we are to obſerue, to whom this duty doth apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine; namely, to all thoſe who are made members of the <note place="margin">That all the faithfull muſt labor to gaine others to the Church.</note> church, whether they be publike or priuate perſons; for there is none which are in reſpect of their meanneſſe of gifts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted, ſeeing there is not any who hath receiued ſuch a ſmall talent, but that if he will profitably imploy it, he may thereby gaine ſome glory to his Lord and maiſter, and in ſome reſpect or other, bring ſome benefit to his brethren, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by inſtruction, conſolation, exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or holy example of life. But howſoeuer this duty belongeth to all, yet eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to Gods Miniſters, who are appointed of God, both to be the ſpirituall fathers by whom men are begotten vnto God, and conuerted to the faith; and alſo to be the nurſes, who by the milke of the word are to nouriſh and bring vp in their ſpirituall growth, thoſe who are regenerate and added to the Church. And therefore they are with all care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to preach the word, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the ignorant, exhorting thoſe that are backward, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading the obſtinate, confirming the weake, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and incouraging thoſe which are ready to faint, and by all meanes labouring, that thoſe who are not conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, may be gained vnto Chriſt; and likewiſe, that thoſe who are already added to the Church, may bee more and more ſtrengthened and confirmed in their ſpirituall vnion with Chriſt, and communion with the Saints.</p>
            <pb n="149" facs="tcp:10737:81"/>
            <p> Fourthly, we are to obſerue, to whom this duty is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, namely, to our brothers and ſiſters, that is, thoſe who are already, and thoſe that may be hereafter our brethren and ſiſters: and in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> we do not know who theſe are, becauſe Gods <note place="margin">That we muſt labour to informe all in Gods trueth.</note> ſecret counſaile &amp; decree of election is known only to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, therfore we are to exhort, inſtruct, and perſwade all to become members of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church, ſo far as in regard of our ſtate and calling we poſſiblie can: for the Spirit bloweth where it liſteth, and can eaſilie cauſe Lions, Tigers, and Cockatrices, to become the ſheepe of Chriſt; hee can make idolatrous <hi>Abraham</hi> the fether of the faithfull; bloodie and barbarous <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> an humble conuert; a perſecuting <hi>Saul</hi> a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <hi>Paul;</hi> and a leaud cheefe a holy confeſſor: and therfore ſay not in thy heart, I will ſpare my labour, becauſe this or that man is too wicked, too worldlie, too couetous, too proud to make a Chriſtian, ſeeing the Lord is able of ſtones to raiſe vp children vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> to humble the moſt proud and obſtinate, and to ſanctifie the moſt prophane; neither is hee onely able to doe it, but alſo often doth it, to ſhew the infinite riches of his wiſedome, power, mercie and goodneſſe, and that our ſaluation is not for our owne works or worthineſſe, but of his owne free grace and vndeſerued loue, that ſo he may be all in all, and haue the whole glorie of his owne worke.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, we are to obſerue the maine arguments which the <note place="margin">The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which we muſt vſe for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> faithfull are to vſe, that they may perſwade others to aſcend with them, out of the land of darkeneſſe, into the kingdome and Church of Chriſt: namely, becauſe they were the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, and therefore they are to aſcend into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of their Lord and redeemer. And leſt their ſinnes, and Gods iuſtice and wrath, ſhould diſcourage them, it is further ſaid, that they haue obtained mercie and remiſſion of their ſinnes, and are now reconciled vnto God in Chriſt. Whence we learne, what is the ſtrongeſt inducement, and moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible argument to mooue any to leaue the kingdome of darkeneſſe, and to adioyne themſelues vnto the Church of God, namely, when they heare, and hearing beleeue, that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:10737:82"/> they who were aliants and ſtrangers, are now in Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Gods ſubiects and ſeruants; that they whom the law for their grieuous ſinnes excluded from all mercie, and made obnoxious to Gods wrath, are now in Chriſt made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Gods mercie, whereby they haue the remiſſion of their ſinnes, and are ſo reconciled to their Lord and Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne. So long as a malefactor, who hath deſerued death, knoweth that his Prince is iuſtly diſpleaſed with him, and intendeth to proſecute the law againſt him, hee fleeth his kingdome, and liueth in voluntarie exile: but if hee heare that the princes ſonne fauoureth him, and hath obtained his fathers pardon, and reconciled him vnto him, this is a ſtrong motiue to perſwade him to leaue the ſtrange countrie where he liueth, and to returne againe into the kingdome of his Soueraigne. So we (who are grieuous malefactours; which by tranſgreſſing Gods law haue made our ſelues ſubiect to to his wrath, and obnoxious to the puniſhment of the law, eternall death, whileſt wee remaine in this caſe) flee from Gods preſence, and as much as in vs lieth (though it neuer lieth in vs) we baniſh our ſelues out of his kingdome and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction; but when we heare that Chriſt his dearely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſonne hath obtained our pardon, and reconciled vs to his father, then, and not before, we approach his preſence, and adioyne our ſelues to his kingdome. It is then the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpell which gathereth vs into Chriſts king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. For it is Gods ſtrong power vnto ſaluation to al that beleeue, whereby he perſwadeth vs to come out of Satans kingdome, and to adioyne our ſelues vnto his Church. And therefore thoſe who ſeeke the conuerſion of others, they muſt not onely denounce legall threatnings againſt ſinne, for this will make men rather flee from God, then come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but hauing by the law brought them to a ſight of their miſerie, in regard of the curſe thereof, the anger of God, death and condemnation which they haue deſerued, then they are to preach the glad tidings of the Goſpell, whereby they may be aſſured of the remiſſion of their ſins, and reconciliation with God; and ſo be mooued to come
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:10737:82"/> vnto Chriſt, and to adioyne themſelues to his Church. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples hereof we haue: Act. 2. 38. 39. 2. Cor. 5. 18. 19. 20. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3 26. That we muſt continuallie labour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert others to the faith.</note> Gal. 3. 26. 27. 28.</p>
            <p>Now we are further to obſerue, that we are not to deliuer this glad tidings of the Goſpell, for the conuerſion of thoſe who are not yet called, once or twice, or diuers times; but continually till they be conuerted, we muſt teach them, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade and exhort them to aſcend out of the land of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, into the kingdome of Chriſt: for hee doth not define and determine a certaine number, but indefinitely and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely commandeth vs that we ſhould ſpeake vnto them. For God calleth not all at the ſame houre, but ſome at one time, and ſome at another, neither doth he make the word effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all for the conuerſion of all ſinners at the firſt hearing, but in ſome he lets it often outwardly ſound in their eares, before by the inward working of his Spirit he openeth them, and inclineth their hearts to beleeue and imbrace it; leſt wee ſhould aſcribe the whole praiſe of our conuerſion vnto the miniſtery of man, which is principally due to his holy ſpirit, who is the chiefe cauſe thereof. As therefore the poole of Betheſda did not at all times cure diſeaſes, but onely when the Angell deſcended and infuſed vertue into the water, and yet neuertheleſſe the people at all times watched that they might be readie to put in their friends when the opportune time came; ſo theſe riuers and ſtreames of the Goſpell, which runne from the ſanctuarie, haue not alwaies vertue and power in them to heale our diſeaſes and ſores of ſinne, but then onely when the ſpirit of God deſcendeth, and by his ſecret working infuſeth vertue thereunto; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee are continuallie to watch for this time, in the meane while vſing the meanes continually appointed by God to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Neither doth he determine the preſence, before whom, or the place where this dutie muſt bee performed, but indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely and abſolutely hee inioyneth vs to ſpeake vnto our brethren and ſiſters. Whence we learne, that there is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or place exempted from this dutie, but wee are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:10737:83"/> all in all places to come vnto Chriſt, and to leaue the kingdome of darkeneſſe; publickly in the miniſterie of the word, and in priuat conferences, at home and abroad, in the congregation, and in our chambers, as occaſion ſhall be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for gaining our brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto Chriſts kingdom. For as the ſpirit of God is reſtrained to no time, ſo neither to any place, but he conuerteth both when he will, and alſo where he will.</p>
            <p>The ſixth thing to be obſerued, is the change of the names, <note place="margin">Great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the effects of the law and the Goſpell.</note> 
               <hi>Lo-ammi,</hi> into <hi>Ammi,</hi> and <hi>Lo-ruchamah</hi> into <hi>Ruchamah;</hi> wherby is ſignified that there is a great change in the time of the Goſpell, from the ſtate of things vnder the law: for thoſe whom the law ſcattered, the Goſpell gathereth; thoſe whom the law made ſtrangers and enemies, the Goſpell maketh ſubiects and friends; thoſe whom the law debarred of mercy, are by the Goſpel receiued to mercy; thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, the Goſpel iuſtifieth and ſaueth: ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> now enmity is turned into frendſhip, iudgement into mercy, death and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation into life and eternal ſaluation, in &amp; by Chriſt our Sauiour. The conſideration whereof as it ſhould fill our harts with ſound comfort, ſo alſo with true thankfulnes, and our mouthes alſo with Gods praiſes, who hath cauſed this happy change, &amp; turned our griefe and ſorrow into ioy &amp; gladnes.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, whereas God inioyneth vs, to inuite others vnto <note place="margin">Mans miſerie, the lawes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie, and Chriſts ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>encie.</note> Chriſt, by calling them <hi>Ruchamah,</hi> that is, ſuch as haue obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned mercie, he herein includeth their miſerie, the lawes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie in freeing them from it, &amp; that through Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and Chriſts merits alone we haue ſaluation. For the firſt, it is include in the word, mercie; for mercie doth preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe miſerie, both in reſpect of our ſinnes, and alſo the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which for them was due vnto vs; and the lawes impotencie, for if we could haue obtained ſaluation by the law, then ſhould wee not haue needed mercie, becauſe wee ſhould haue been ſaued by our owne merits; and laſtlie, that we haue not ſaluation of or by our ſelues, but in Chriſt and for his merits; for when God was diſpleaſed, there muſt be ſome meanes to pacifie him; when wee had excluded our ſelues from Gods mercie, there muſt be ſome other way to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:10737:83"/> recouer it, which could not be any meanes of our owne, for wee in ſtead of pacifying God for our old ſinnes, were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually readie to anger him with new, and in ſtead of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, wee by our new tranſgreſſions heaped vpon our ſelues new puniſhments; and therefore in Chriſt alone, Gods mercie is obtained, who hath ſatiſfied his iuſtice and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed his wrath by diſcharging our debt, bearing our ſins, and ſuffering that puniſhment which wee by them had moſt iuſtly deſerued.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <p>ANd ſo much for the conſequent dutie to bee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the faithfull, after themſelues are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Euangelicall benefits. In the next place the Prophet returneth to the legall threatnings; in theſe words: Verſ. 2. <hi>Pleade</hi> (or, <hi>contend) with your mother, pleade with her,</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſ. </seg>2</label> 
                  <hi>for ſhe is not my wife</hi> (or, as the word is ſometimes taken, <hi>that ſhee is not my wife) neither am I her huſband; but let her take away</hi> (or, <hi>that ſhee may take away) her fornications out of her ſight, and her adulteries from betweene her breaſts.</hi> Where the Lord commandeth that a diuorce ſhould be proclaimed betweene him and the Iſraelites, and withall ſheweth the cauſe or end of this denunciation, namely, that they might repent and turne from their ſpirituall whoredomes.</p>
               <p>But let vs come to the expoſition of the words, and after <note place="margin">Expoſition.</note> obſerue the doctrines which ariſe out of them. <hi>Plead with your mother.</hi> Theſe wordes may ſeeeme to contradict the former: for there the Lord promiſeth, that he would gather his Church, and vnite them vnto Chriſt, that he might be her head, ſhe his members, he her husband, and ſhe his ſpouſe; and now preſently he threatneth that he wil giue her a bil of diuorce, and break off the mariage between them. But we are to know, that the former words were an Euangelical promiſe, which was not preſently to be performed, but in the time of the Goſpel, after the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of Chriſt: but in the meane time becauſe the Iſraelites were not terrified with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> former threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, nor allured to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance by Gods gracious promiſes, therfore hauing by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> former conſolations comforted Gods
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:10737:84"/> children amongſt them, who were truely humbled; now hee beginneth againe to thunder out Gods threatnings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the obdurate and impenitent, ſhewing that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding God would extend ſuch mercie to the faithfull in the time of the Goſpell, yet this ſhould bee no priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to exempt them who liued in impenitencie from Gods iudgements, but hee would for their ſinnes certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reiect them, vnleſſe they ſpeedelie repented of them. And this is vſuall with the Prophets, to intermixe mercie with iudgements, conſolations with threatnings, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neither the humbled may deſpaire, nor the obdurate and impenitent preſume: as alſo to mingle their prophecies which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the preſent time, with thoſe which concerned the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Meſſias, in the time of Goſpell; for as their maine end was to point at Chriſt, that at his comming their prophecies being fulfilled in him, he might be receiued; ſo they were not to neglect their preſent auditorie, but by ſhewing their ſinnes and Gods iudgements, to bring them to God by true repentance. And if this bee obſerued it will giue great light to the vnderſtanding of them, whereas contrariwiſe the not obſeruing hereof cauſeth great confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and obſcuritie.</p>
               <p>But let vs come to the words themſelues. <hi>Plead with your mother,</hi> &amp;c. Where we are to conſider, who they are whom the Lord commandeth to plead as children: ſecondly, who this mother is, that is to bee diuorced: and thirdly, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce it ſelfe. Concerning the firſt, diuers are of diuers iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſome vnderſtand it of the faithfull in the time of the Goſpell, that they after they were added to the Church ſhould plead with their mother the Church of the Iewes, that laying her ſinnes to her charge they might bring her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. But this cannot agree with the reſt that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; for they are commanded to accuſe her for her idolatry, in forſaking the Lord and worſhipping the Heathen gods, which ſinne was not committed by the Church of the Iewes in the time of the Goſpell, nor after their returne out of the captiuitie of Babylon.</p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:10737:84"/>
               <p> Others vnderſtand it of the two Tribes of the kingdome of <hi>Iuda,</hi> that euery one of them who were faithfull, ſhould admoniſh their mother; that is, their Church and ſynagogue, that ſhe ſhould take example of the ten Tribes, and forſake her idolatry, leſt ſhee ſhould likewiſe be diuorced and reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. But this is not likely, ſeeing the Prophet was not ſent to the Iewes, but to the ten Tribes; and therefore to them he directeth his ſpeech for their conuerſion, and not vnto the other, who were not belonging to his charge.</p>
               <p>Others expound it of the faithfull who liued in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets time amongſt the Iſraelites, eſpecially the Prophets and Prieſts called to this publike office, that they fearing God, and hating the wickedneſſe of the times, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue the Church and Synagogue of Iſrael for her ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all whoredomes. The which their expoſition though I reiect not, yet I thinke an other more probable, and better fitting the circumſtances of the place.</p>
               <p>And that is of thoſe who expound it generally of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious and hypocriticall Iſraelites, who when they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued for their ſinnes, and heard Gods iudgements de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt them by the Prophet, in ſtead of laying them to heart, that they might be humbled thereby, were ready to plead againſt God himſelfe, and to condemne him of vntruth and cruelty. For whereas the Lord had threatned that hee would vtterly reiect them, they were ready to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect; firſt, that this could not ſtand with the truth of Gods promiſes, made to <hi>Abraham</hi> concerning the multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his ſeede. To which obiection the Prophet anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the two laſt verſes of the former chapter, as I haue ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe the Prophet had deferred the accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of that promiſe vnto the time of the Meſſias, the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crits would be ready in the ſecond place to obiect; that God had promiſed perpetually and continually to be their God, and that they ſhould be his people; and therefore if he did reiect them, though it were but for a time, he muſt needes be vntrue of his promiſe. To this the Prophet anſwereth, that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:10737:85"/> this imputation was not to be laid vpon God, but vpon their mother the Synagogue and Church of Iſrael: for whereas the Lord had ioyned her in mariage vnto himſelfe, a mutuall ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation being made betweene them; on the Lords part, that he would acknowledge her as his ſpouſe, protect her, and multiply his benefits vpon her; on her part, that ſhee would keepe her coniugall faith plighted vnto him, and wholly and onely reſerue her ſelfe for his worſhip and ſeruice; ſhee had broken her couenant and falſified her faith, by forſaking the Lord, and proſtituting her ſelfe vnto idols, and had moſt vnthankfully aſcribed vnto them, all thoſe benefits which the Lord had beſtowed vpon her. And therefore their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce was not to be aſcribed vnto any inconſtancy or cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty in God, but to their owne whoredomes and vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.</p>
               <p>By the children then who are to pleade with their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we are to vnderſtand all thoſe amongſt the Iſraelites, who vpon the hearing of the diuorce and reiection of the Church, were ready to expoſtulate with God, and (to excuſe themſelues) would not ſticke to lay the fault of their reiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vpon him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by their mother in this place, we are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Synagogue and Church of Iſrael, and more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally their rulers and gouernours both eccleſiaſticall and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill: for whereas they aboue others ſhould haue maintained Gods pure worſhip &amp; ſeruice, and contained their inferiours in holy obedience; they were the firſt who did forſake God, and betooke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to the worſhipping of idols, drawing others by their authority and example into the like wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and that in a twofold reſpect: the firſt concerned their religion, when as they were miſlead by the falſe doctrine of their eccleſiaſticall gouernours, and drawne from God to their idols: the other concerned their policy, when as by their ciuill rulers, they were moued to ioyne themſelues in league and in neere friendſhippe with idolatrous Nations, whereby alſo they themſelues were corrupted and ſeduced.</p>
               <p>Now we are further to obſerue, that hee redoubleth the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:10737:85"/> word, <hi>pleade,</hi> or <hi>contend:</hi> whereby he implieth the importune impudency of the people, which was ſuch, that their mouthes would not eaſily be ſtopped, but ſtill they would calumniate Gods iuſtice and truth; and therefore with greater earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe (which is often expreſſed by ſuch redoubled ſpeeches) he biddeth them to plead againſt their mother againe and againe, and to lay the fault where it was, not vpon God, but vpon themſelues. As if he ſhould haue ſaid; Doe not pleade and expoſtulate with mee, in that your mother is diuorced, and you reiected as an adulterous iſſue; for the husband is not to be blamed for putting away an adultereſſe, but ſhee rather for her filthineſſe and vnfaithfulneſſe: and therefore, ſeeing your mother hath forſaken me, and proſtituted her ſelfe to idols, acquit me of all wrong and iniury, and contend and expoſtulate with her, in that by her vnfaithfulneſſe and vncleanneſſe, ſhe hath moued me iuſtly to diuorce her from me, and to reiect you as being an adulterous iſſue of an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous mother.</p>
               <p>The third thing to be conſidered, is the diuorce it ſelfe betweene God and the Church of Iſrael, expreſſed in theſe words; <hi>for ſhee is not my wife, neither am I her huſband.</hi> Which that we may vnderſtand, we muſt know what the mariage betweene them was; namely, a contract and mutuall ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; on Gods part that he would be her Lord and husband, to loue, protect, and prouide for her, multiplying his grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous benefits from time to time, as he ſhould ſee moſt for her good; on her part, that ſhee would forſake all others, and cleaue onely and wholly vnto the Lord, louing, obeying, worſhipping, and performing all holy duties vnto him; and finally, keeping this her faith plighted vnto him inuiolable. They are therefore ſaid to be diuorced, when as this contract is broken off, and the couenants not performed; as when the Lord not acknowledging her for his ſpouſe, doth caſt her off, and ceaſeth to defend and prouide for her; and when ſhe withdrawing her loue from God; and fixing it vpon idols, breaketh her mariage faith, refuſing to worſhippe and obey the Lord her true husband, and proſtituting her ſelfe by ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:10737:86"/> whoredome vnto falſe gods.</p>
               <p>Now that the cauſe of this diuorce was not in the Lord, but in the Church of Iſrael, appeareth by the order of the words: where firſt it is ſaid, that ſhe was not his wife; and then, that he was not her husband: for the Lord did not forſake her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhee forſooke him, hee did not deny to bee her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, before ſhe refuſed to be his wife; hee did not ceaſe to performe his couenants which hee made with her, of grace, protection, and preſeruation, before ſhe withdrew her loue, falſified her faith, denied her ſeruice and obedience, and went a whoring after ſtrange gods. And therefore there was no cauſe, why for this diuorce they ſhould expoſtulate with God, and impute any fault vnto him; but rather they were to lay the blame vpon themſelues, who by their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall fornications had broken off the mariage knot, and had refuſed to be the Lords ſpouſe; ſo that hee was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to proclaime this diuorce, becauſe ſhe had firſt refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him.</p>
               <p>The like place vnto this we haue, Eſay 50. 1. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord; Where is the bill of your mothers diuorcement, whom I haue cast off? or who is the creditour vnto whom I haue ſolde you? Behold, for your iniquities are ye ſold, and becauſe of your tranſgreſſions is your mother forſaken.</hi> Where the Lord expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulateth with the Iews concerning the cauſe of their reiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſheweth that the cauſe was not in him, but in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: and this he proueth by an olde rite and cuſtome vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, which was, that thoſe who were put away by the husband, had a bill of diuorce giuen vnto them; and that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 24. 1.</note> parents which were deeply indebted, ſold their children to ſatisfie their creditors; as appeareth, Exod. 21. 7. 2. King. 4. 1. But I (ſaith the Lord) neuer put you away; for if I did, where <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod</hi> 21 7. 2. <hi>King.</hi> 4. 1.</note> is the bill of diuorcement? neither did I ſell you, for where is the creditour to whom I ſtand indebted? And therefore the fault is not in me, but in your own iniquities, and in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions of your mother, why you are ſold, and ſhee diuor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. So Ier. 3. 8. Ezech. 16. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 3 8 <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of the diuorce, which the Lord
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:10737:86"/> commandeth ſhould be denounced. The doctrines which <note place="margin">The Law and the Goſpell muſt be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed in the miniſterie of the word.</note> hence ariſe are diuers. Firſt, out of this mixture of Legall comminations, with Euangelicall conſolations, Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters may learne ſpirituall diſcretion, neither onely to thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der out the threatnings of the Law, nor wholly to ſtand vpon Euangelicall promiſes, but in their ſermons to mixe the one with the other, that whileſt they beate downe the pride and preſumption of ſecure hypocrites, they doe not altogether exanimate &amp; deiect thoſe who are truly humbled; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, that whileſt they comfort and raiſe vp Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren who are afflicted in mind and deiected, they doe not confirme proud hypocrites in their ſecuritie and preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Neither is this courſe profitable alone in reſpect of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and ſecure worldlings, but alſo in reſpect of Gods deere children: for being partly fleſh, and partlie ſpirit, as in reſpect of their ſpirituall part, they haue neede to heare the ſweete comforts of the Goſpell for the confirmation of their faith; ſo had they in regard of the fleſh neede to heare often of the threatnings of the Law, to reſtraine them from ſinne, to beate downe pride, preſumption and ſecuritie, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them in holy obedience.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we may obſerue the nature of hypocrites, who <note place="margin">The nature of hypocrites to expoſtulate with God.</note> when they ſuffer the puniſhment due vnto their ſinnes, are ready to expoſtulate with God, and to calumniate his iuſtice of crueltie, as though their puniſhment were either altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vndeſerued, or elſe at leaſt farre greater then their ſins. To this purpoſe they vſe all friuolous pretences to excuſe their faults, laying them of themſelues vpon others, yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then faile, they will not ſticke to accuſe God that they may excuſe themſelues. And therefore the Lord is faine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes to expoſtulate the matter with them, to cleare himſelfe from all imputation of fault, and to conuince them of their ſinnes, that they may be brought to true repentance. An example hereof we haue in our firſt parents: Gen. 3. 12. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 12. 4 19 <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 35. <hi>Mal</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:10737:87"/>
               <p> Thirdly, we here learne, when we ſuffer affliction, or beare <note place="margin">We muſt not murmure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God in our afflictions.</note> our puniſhment, that we doe not murmure and expoſtulate with God, as though he dealed more ſeuerely and rigorouſly with vs then we haue deſerued; but let vs deſcend into our ſelues, and examine our owne hearts and conſciences, and ſo ſhall wee find that not the Lord, but our ſelues are in fault, that our puniſhment is farre leſſe then our ſinnes, and that it is the great <hi>mercie of the Lord that we are not vtterlie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,</hi> as the Church confeſſeth, Lament. 3. 22. And this <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lament.</hi> 3. 22.</note> courſe muſt be taken of euery one of vs, before we will euer be truely humbled, and brought vnto God by vnfained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or before the Lord will euer bee mooued to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don our ſinnes, or releaſe our puniſhment. For none will euer ſorrow for thoſe ſinnes, of which they thinke they are not guiltie, there is none wil lay them to hart &amp; be humbled vnder the weight of them, ſo long as they pretend excuſes, and ſeeke to put off their burthen from their owne to others ſhoulders, and ſo long as wee content our ſelues with theſe fig-leaues, we wil neuer looke after a better garment to hide our nakedneſſe. Againe, the Lord will neuer abſolue vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we condemne our ſelues, he will not pardon our ſinnes till we ſetting aſide all excuſes, ingenuouſly and freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe them; he will neuer caſe vs of this burthen, whileſt with falſe pretences we ſeeke to vnloade our ſelues; neither will he euer make vs partakers of his mercy, till we acknowledge that we haue deſerued the extremity of his iuſtice, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the former examples.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, wee are to obſerue, that the children are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <note place="margin">That particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men may expoſtulate with their mother the Church.</note> to expoſtulate, not onely one with another, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with their mother the Church, that ſo both the particular members, and the whole Church in generall, comming to a ſight of their ſinnes, and condemning themſelues for them, they might bee brought to true repentance. Whence wee learne what dutie is owed by children to their parents, and by particular members to the whole body of the Church, namely, they are ſo to honour them, that God bee not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured, ſo to excuſe them, that God bee not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:10737:87"/> ſo to hide their faults from others, that they doe not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly foſter them in themſelues. The Papiſts crie out vpon vs for diſcouering the nakedneſſe of their Church, which they falſely call our mother; they will not indure, that her ſinnes ſhould be reprehended, and affirme it to bee impudent ſaucineſſe, for the children to reprooue the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents faults. But firſt we anſwere, that ſhe is not our mother, but a common ſtrumpet, who long agoe was diuorced from God, for her ſpirituall fornications. And ſecondly, though ſhe were our mother, yet ſhe were to be reprooued for her faults, that ſo ſhe might be brought to a ſight of her ſinnes, and turne vnto the Lord her husband whom ſhe hath forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by her whoredomes.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, we may obſerue, the grieuouſneſſe of the ſinne of <note place="margin">Idolatrie a grieuous ſin.</note> idolatrie, which appeareth in the greatneſſe of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is vtter reiection and ſeparation from God: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinnes mooue the Lord to afflict his ſpouſe, but this cauſeth him to diuorce her; other ſinnes prouoke the Lord to correct his children, but this mooueth him to diſherit them. Now what more fearefull puniſhment can bee imagined, then to bee diuorced from God, to bee excluded from his grace, protection and preſeruation? al which idolaters incurre through their ſpirituall whoredomes. The conſideration whereof ſhould make vs to flee this ſinne, that ſo wee may eſcape the puniſhment.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing which we are to obſerue, is out of the order <note place="margin">God reiecteth not the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth him.</note> of the words: namely, that the Lord neuer reiecteth his Church from being his ſpouſe, before ſhee hath caſt him off from being her husband; he neuer withdraweth his grace, mercie and protection, and prouidence from watching ouer vs, till wee alienate our minds from him, denying vnto him our faith, obedience and alleageance: and therefore let vs cleaue vnto the Lord, and he will moſt certainely cleaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs; let vs keepe our faith and couenant with him, and hee will neuer faile vs; let vs euer acknowledge him for our huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and father, and hee will acknowledge vs for his ſpouſe and children.</p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:10737:88"/>
               <p> And ſo much concerning the diuorce. Now the end why the Lord would haue it denounced, is twofold, firſt, that hereby they might be mooued to repent of their wickednes; and ſecondly that repenting, they might eſcape puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; verſe. 3. The firſt end is expreſſed in theſe words; <hi>that ſhe may take away her fornications out of her ſight,</hi> (or from her face) <hi>and her adulteries from betweene her breaſts.</hi> In which <note place="margin">Expoſition.</note> words the Lord ſheweth the cauſe, why hee would haue the diuorce betweene him, and the Church of Iſrael proclaimed, namely, not for any hatred of her perſon, but that being brought vnto a ſight of their ſinnes, they might repent of them, and ſo forſaking their ſpirituall whoredomes, they might be receiued againe of the Lord as his ſpouſe, as it is in the latter part of the chapter.</p>
               <p>But let vs come to the meaning of them. Some vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by <hi>fornication of the face,</hi> externall idolatrie, and by the <hi>adulterie of the breaſts,</hi> that idolatrie which is in ſecret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. But as I take it the Prophets purpoſe here, is to ſhew that the people were growne impudent in their ſinnes, ſo that they made an outward profeſſion of them, not caring who beheld them. For before he had ſhewed that the Lord had diuorced them, and conſequently, that they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted adulterie, and plaied the harlots, for in other caſes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorces are not by God approoued; and now he intimateth that they had the conditions and qualities of an harlot; for as harlots in continuance of time grow paſt ſhame, ſo that they doe not only in ſecret commit adulterie, but publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie make profeſſion of it, as of their trade, decking themſelues with ſuch gorgious and gariſh apparrell, as beſeemeth not honeſt matrons, glauncing with wanton eyes at their louers, painting their faces, and laying out their naked breaſts, that they may not onely profeſſe themſelues wanton and laſciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but alſo with theſe baites allure others to commit wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes with them: ſo the Church of Iſrael, liuing in ſpiritual whoredome, grew to that impudencie in ſinne, that ſhee was not content to commit it in ſecret, but alſo to profeſſe it, yea to defend and boaſt of it; and becauſe ſhe would be known
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:10737:88"/> to bee an harlot, who had forſaken the Lord, and giuen her ſelfe ouer to commit this ſpirituall vncleanneſſe, therefore in euery corner they erected images and idols, they adorned them with gold and pretious ornaments, they in moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent manner proſtituted themſelues vnto them, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſpirituall whoredome in the ſight of all the world, worſhipping and ſeruing them in ſtead of the true God; and like ſhameleſſe harlots, they did not onely themſelues com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this wickedneſſe, but alſo allured others to goe a who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with them.</p>
               <p>Theſe words then are metaphoricall, borrowed from the practiſe of harlots, who that they may diſplay the filthy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe of their mindes, and allure others to vnlawfull luſt, doe ſeeke to intice them by wanton lookes, painting of their faces, and laying out their naked breaſts: and hence it is that the Prophet attributeth fornication to the face and eies, and adultery to the breaſts; becauſe vnto harlots theſe parts are the inſtruments of their vncleanneſſe, whereby they te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, and as it were proclame, that they are ready and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to commit whoredome, and alſo allure others to ioyne with them in their beaſtlineſſe. So the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith of ſome, that <hi>their eyes were full of adulterie:</hi> 2. Pet. 2. 14. becauſe by their eyes they diſcouered their adulterous <note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 14.</note> hearts.</p>
               <p>Now in theſe wordes the Prophet aimeth at three things: firſt, hee cloſely intimateth what was the cauſe of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce; namely, their idolatry, which he calleth adultery and fornication, which they committed with all audacious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudency openly and in the ſight of all.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hee cleareth God of all imputation of fault, in that he diuorced them not for any hatred to their perſons, nor for ſmall tranſgreſſions, but for their groſſe idolatry and ſpirituall whoredomes; and therefore there was no cauſe why they ſhould contend with him, but with their mother. For if ſhee would leaue her ſinnes, and returne vnto him by vnfained repentance, hee would receiue her to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:10737:89"/> and acknowledge her for his ſpouſe; as hee after ſheweth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly and principally, he laboureth by earneſt exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to moue her to leaue her ſpirituall whoredomes, and her profeſſed audaciouſneſſe and ſhameleſſe impudency, in proſtituting her ſelfe vnto idols, and forſaking him their Lord and husband, not in a ſecret corner, but in the view of all the world.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of theſe words. The inſtructions which from hence we gather are theſe. Firſt, we may obſerue, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The Do∣ctrines. </seg>
                  </label> that though the Lord by his Prophet had ſharpely reproued <note place="margin">That the ſinnes of the people are often to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</note> the people for their ſpirituall whoredomes in the former chapter, and denounced his fearefull iudgements againſt them; yet becauſe they did not repent, but obſtinately and impudently continued in their idolatry, the Lord conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not himſelfe with once reprouing of them, but cauſeth his Prophet to beate againe &amp; againe vpon the ſame point, that at leaſt by his importunity he might bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Whence we are to learne, that it is not ſufficient, either in the publike miniſtery of the word, or in priuate confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, to reprehend and beate downe ſinne once onely, but conſidering how many ſhifts and deuices the hypocriſie of mans heart findeth to hide, excuſe, and extenuate their ſins, and how ſoone they forget and caſt behinde them the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their ſinnes, and Gods iudgements due vnto them, it muſt not be thought much, either of publike or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate perſons, oftentimes to vſe the ſame admonitions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, and to denounce againe and againe the ſame iudgements of God againſt the ſame ſinnes, which are not as yet forſaken by true repentance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee may obſerue the infinite mercy of God, who when his ſpouſe the Church, had innumerable times <note place="margin">Gods mercy in inuiting the people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note> committed ſpirituall whoredome with idols, and profeſſed her filthineſſe like an impudent harlot openly to all the world, yet laboureth to bring her to repentance, that ſo hee might receiue her to grace and fouour againe: for to this end
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:10737:89"/> he cauſeth her ſinnes to be laid before her, and the diuorce betweene him and her to be denounced; not becauſe he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her, or was delighted with her reiection and deſtruction, but that ſhe might forſake her idolatry, which ſo impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhe profeſſed, and returne vnto him her Lord &amp; husband, that ſo he might receiue her to grace, and pardon her former wickedneſſe. And therefore when we heare our ſinnes ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproued, and the iudgements of God denounced, let vs not thinke that this is done for want of loue either in God or in his Miniſters; but to this end, that wee ſhould hereby bee brought to true repentance, and ſo bee receiued into Gods grace and fauour.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, out of the metaphors and borrowed ſpeeches here vſed, we may obſerue, that the ſinne of vncleanneſſe, is <note place="margin">Of the forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of painted faces and naked breaſts.</note> not onely committed in fact, but that alſo there is a fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the face, and an adultery of the breaſts, when as har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots with glancing and wanton lookes, by painting of their faces, and laying out of their breaſts, doe not onely by theſe ſignes teſtifie the adultery and vncleanneſſe of their hearts, but alſo with theſe baits of luſt, indeuour to allure others to commit filthineſſe, and to inflame their hearts with the fire of vnlawfull concupiſcence. Whereby may appeare, how common this ſinne of adultery and vncleanneſſe is in our times, wherein the ſignes and meanes thereof do ſo abound; ſeeing not onely thoſe who are harlots by profeſſion, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſuch as would be reputed pure virgins and chaſte wiues, ſhew theſe outward ſignes of their inward filthineſſe, and vſe theſe baits to catch the fooliſh in the nets of vncleannes, by painting their faces &amp; ſetting forth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues with adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate beauty, and by laying out their breaſts after a whoriſh manner to be ſeene and touched: for is it likely, that thoſe who lay the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhew, would haue them only ſeen? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath this corruption of manners entred into the court alone, where wantonneſſe and immodeſty challenge vnto themſelues a place by the right of preſcription and long cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome; but it is crept alſo into the City and Country, amongſt thoſe that ſhould be modeſt virgins and graue matrons, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:10737:90"/> examples of ſobriety vnto others. Euen here naturall beauty is hid with a painted vizard, and naked breaſts are laid out to the view; if at leaſt they may be called naked which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly couered with falſe colours, or vncouered when as they are masked in a net.</p>
               <p>But as there is no ſin ſo vile, which maketh not ſome kind of Apologie for it ſelfe; ſo this, againſt which I inueigh, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <note place="margin">An excuſe of vaine women anſwered.</note> not her excuſes: for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe who are vain &amp; wanton in their attires, haue their immodeſty laid to their charge, they are ready to ſay, that whatſoeuer they ſeeme in ſhew, yet their hearts are chaſte and honeſt. But to theſe I reply, that if they haue the hearts of honeſt and chaſte matrons, what haue they to doe with the habit of an harlot? why doe they <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezra</hi> 3 9.</note> diſguiſe themſelues vnder the vizard of a falſe beauty, vnleſſe they meant to deceiue and allure? why do they make ſhew of their wares, vnleſſe they would offer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſale? why do they diſplay the banners of luſt, vnleſſe they meant to be at defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with chaſtity and all honeſty? why doe they play the hypocrits by appearing that they are not? if they be honeſt in deed, why ſhould they ſeeme harlots in ſhew? if they be diſhoneſt in ſhew and truth, why doe they ſlander and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace the name of honeſty and chaſtity, by intitling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto it? In a word, if either they are pure virgins; or chaſte matrons, and would haue others ſo to iudge of them, let them take away their fornications from their face, and their adulteries from betweene their breaſt.</p>
               <p>But they further anſwer, that though in their owne iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they like not of theſe practiſes, yet they yeelde vnto <note place="margin">A ſecond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe who paint their faces and diſcouer their breaſts.</note> them in regard of the faſhion, becauſe they muſt be like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of their ſort and ranke. To which I anſwere, that if this be a faſhion, it is the faſhion of harlots, who firſt inuented it, and moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly practiſe it: and therefore why ſhould this moue any that are honeſt women to imbrace it, &amp; not rather to deteſt it? that we are commanded by God, not to faſhion our ſelues to the world, nor to follow a multitude in that which is euill; that if they will follow the faſhion, they muſt ſet themſelues to worke wickedneſſe, ſeeing no faſhion is
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:10737:90"/> more common; that thoſe who for faſhions ſake are thus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt and impudent, would become farre worſe if it were the faſhion; that thoſe who profeſſe themſelues Chriſtians, ſhould faſhion themſelues according to the example of thoſe who are modeſt, ſober, and religious, and not of the wanton and laſciuious; for otherwiſe they will plainely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer themſelues, that their hearts are corrupt and wicked, ſeeing they like and imbrace rather the faſhion of prophane worldlings, then of the faithfull and vertuous. And laſtly, that if they ſinne for company, they are like for company ſake to ſuffer the puniſhment of ſinne in hell fire.</p>
               <p>But they will ſay, that they doe not thus adorne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, <note place="margin">A third excuſe taken away.</note> either to ſhew their owne luſt, or to prouoke it in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but that their beautie (which in it ſelfe is good and commendable) may be liked and praiſed of the beholders. To this I anſwer, that <hi>vn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Yea but they thus ſet forth themſelues, that they may bee liked and loued of their husbands, vnto whom they cannot make themſelues too amiable. I anſwere, that no wiſe husband would haue his wife ſet out to ſale, if he would reſerue her to his owne proper vſe; that this is but a falſe pretence to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe a falſe beauty. For as the Satyriſt ſaith; <hi>moechis foliata pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantur:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Juuenal. ſat.</hi> 6.</note> they vſe theſe wanton arts, not to pleaſe their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, but to inflame the adulterer; that the habit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:10737:91"/> of an harlot cannot bee pleaſing and amiable vnto any husband that deſireth to haue an honeſt and chaſte wife; that they muſt not ſo labour to pleaſe men, as that in the meane time they diſpleaſe God; for their wanton behauiour and habit is offenſiue, and at leaſt euill in appearance, and therefore to bee forborne of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; they derogate from Gods wiſedome, by altering and adding to his workemanſhippe, which kind of iniury an ordinary artificer cannot patience brooke: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing they are new creatures of their own making, quite altered from their firſt creation, it is not likely that the Lord wil owne or acknowledge them for his worke. In a word, they breake and tranſgreſſe the ſeuenth Commaundement, both by ſhewing the ſignes of wanto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vncleannes, &amp; vſing the means to kindle &amp; inflame luſt both in themſelues &amp; others.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing to be obſerued is, that as all kinds of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, <note place="margin">Sinnes openly profeſſed and defended, moſt odious in Gods ſight.</note> and of all other ſinnes are odious and loathſome vnto the Lord; ſo eſpecially thoſe which are of the face and breaſt, that is, ſuch as are openly profeſſed, and impudently defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Whileſt ſinne lurketh in the ſecret corners of the heart, not daring to ſhew it ſelfe in the face and outward actions, it maketh the ſinner but like a poore fugitiue, who hauing offended his Prince, through ſelfe guiltineſſe ſhunneth his preſence; but when it growes ſo preſumptuous, that it dare ſhew it ſelfe in the face, words, or externall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not onely ſo, but alſo vaunt it ſelfe to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like view, daring Gods iuſtice, and prouoking him as it were to his face; then the ſinner becommeth a proud re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, who regardeth not his Princes preſence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temneth his authoritie; or like vnto an impudent adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe, who not contenting her ſelfe with her ſecret whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, doth proſtitute her ſelfe to her louers in the ſight of her husband; and like <hi>Abſalon,</hi> pitcheth a pauili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on euen at noone day vpon the toppe of the houſe, that hee may bee ſeene of all men. This is the height of ſinne, when as men doe not onely conſent vnto it, but alſo act it; not in a corner, but in the face of the world;
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:10737:91"/> not as bluſhing and being aſhamed at it, but impudently defending it, boaſting and glorying in their wickedneſſe. And as it is the height of ſinne, ſo it ſhall bee plagued with the height of puniſhment, euen with the diuorce and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God: and therefore let all that would bee Gods ſpouſe, aboue all other ſinnes flee theſe; and though they fall through infirmitie humanie frailtie into ſin, yet at leaſt let them take it away from their face, and from betweene their breaſts, that is, let them not defend it, and much leſſe vaunt and glorie in their wickedneſſe.</p>

               <p>ANd ſo much concerning the firſt end of the denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the diuorce, namelie, the repentance of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Now concerning the ſecond end, which is a conſequent of the former, that is to ſay, their freedom from puniſhment, vpon their vnfained repentance: and this either reſpecteth the whole Church or the particular members thereof. The firſt is expreſſed, verſ. 3. <hi>Leſt I ſtrip her naked, and ſet her as</hi>

                  <hi>in the day that ſhe was borne, and make her as a wilderneſſe, and leaue her like a drie land, and ſlay her for thirſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the former verſe the Prophet ſhewed, that the Lord <note place="margin">The expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</note> had diuorced the Church of Iſrael, but howſoeuer he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on her this iudgement, yet ſuch was his infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that in wrath he remembred mercie; for although hee might iuſtly (as husbands vſed to doe in ſuch caſes) when he diuorced her, haue ſtripped her of all his gifts and benefits, yet in mercie he did not thus farre proceed in puniſhing of her, but though he had put her away, hee ſuffered her ſtill to enioy the good things which he had beſtowed vpon her, at leaſt in ſome meaſure: and that to this end, that they might remaine with her as pledges of his loue, not altogether as yet extinguiſhed, and as vndoubted arguments to aſſure her that as he had not diuorced her for any hatred of her perſon, but for her ſinnes, ſo if ſhee would repent of them, hee would bee ready to receiue her againe into his former loue and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.</p>
               <p>But becauſe ſhe abuſed the mercie of God, and continued
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:10737:92"/> in her impenitencie, therefore he threatneth that vnleſſe ſhe would ſeriouſly repent of her ſinnes, he would not only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce her, but alſo ſtrippe and ſpoyle her of all thoſe his gifts and benefits, which he had beſtowed vpon her, and which as yet ſhe inioyed. Wherein the Lord alludeth to the behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of kind husbands, who hauing put away their wiues for their whoredomes, doe notwithſtanding allow vnto them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall maintenance; with which benefits, when they are not reſtrained from their ſinne, and brought to amendment, but rather abuſe their gifts as meanes to further them in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16. 16. 17</note> their vncleanneſſe, and by beſtowing them on their louers; they threaten to ſtrip and ſpoile them of all thoſe benefits which they inioy, and to leaue them deſtitute of all mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. As though he ſhould haue ſaid, Although vpon your diuorce iuſtly cauſed by your whoredomes, I might alſo haue depriued you of all my benefits, which I haue beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, yet ſuch hath been my mercie, that I haue ſpared you hitherto, and ſuffered you to inioy them, in hope of your amendment; but doe not continue to abuſe my patience and mercie, for vnleſſe you repent, and take away your forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and adulteries, which with ſuch audacious impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie you commit, I will ſtrippe you of all my benefits, which as yet you inioy, and leaue you as naked and beggarlie as you were, when I firſt tooke you in mariage.</p>
               <p>Now the benefits which the Lord threatneth to ſpoile the people of Iſrael of, were either temporall and corporall, or elſe ſpirituall; of the firſt ſort were their peace, kingdom, protection from enemies, plentie, and abundance of all worldly profits and delightes; of the other were the law, the prieſthood, ſome relikes of Gods worſhip in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie of the word, in the vſe of the Sacraments, and prayer; the fauour of God and pardon of their ſinnes; from which they were not as yet vtterly excluded, as it may hereby appeare, in that the Lord laboureth to recall them by his Prophet vnto repentance, and forewarneth them of theſe iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that repenting they might eſcape them.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the benefits, of which he threatneth to ſpoile
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:10737:92"/> them. Now the manner and nature of their ſtripping and ſpoyling is further deſcribed and illuſtrated by diuers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons; for firſt hee threatneth to ſtrip them, and to leaue them as deſtitute of all his benefits, as they were at the day of their birth, in theſe words; <hi>and ſet her as in the day that ſhee was borne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the day of the children of Iſraels birth, we may either vnderſtand the day of their forefather <hi>Abraham</hi> his calling out of an idolatrous nation, that hee might be the father of the faithfull; or the day of the peoples deliuerance out of the bondage of Egypt, which I take to be the more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe he ſpeaketh not here of the birth of one man, but of the whole nation. Now this day of the peoples birth was a time wherein they were in great miſerie, pouertie, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie and manifold extremities, and therefore not vnfitly compared to a childs birth, ſeeing in many things it reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth it, in regard of the wretchedneſſe thereof, and that both in reſpect of their perſons, and alſo in reſpect of their ſtate. And firſt for their bodies, as the child is borne ſo impotent that it is vnable to reſiſt the weakeſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie; ſo they came out of Egypt weake, vnskilfull, and vnarmed, altogether vnable to reſiſt their enemies the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians. And ſo in reſpect of their ſoules, as the child is borne defiled in his blood, as it is deſcribed, Ezech. 16. 6. ſo <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16. 6.</note> they were defiled with their ſins, eſpecially their groſſe ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie which they learned of the Egyptians: as the childe is borne deſtitute of wiſedome and actuall vnderſtanding; ſo they were ignorant, and without the ſauing knowledge of God and his true religion. In reſpect of their ſtates likewiſe there is great ſimilitude: for as the child is borne poore and naked; ſo they came out in great pouertie, being not onely deſtitute of the heauenly gifts of Gods Spirit, but alſo of glorie, power and riches: as the childe liueth as it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned a cloſe priſoner in the ſtraite priſon of the wombe; ſo they were held in a ſtraite and miſerable ſeruitude, till God deliuered them: and as in the birth it is in greateſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and extremitie, ſo that it no ſooner breatheth the aire,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:10737:93"/> but it crieth out with ſenſe of paine; ſo they howſoeuer they had formerly indured many miſeries, yet they were in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt extremitie of all, euen as it were in the very birth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance, when as they were purſued by their enemies, and beſet on all ſides with vnauoydable dangers, ſo that in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of ſoule, they cried out for feare. Laſtly, as the child <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.</note> being borne is vnable to helpe it ſelfe, either in reſpect of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence from outward iniuries, or of prouiſion of food and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries: ſo they being brought into the wilderneſſe, were vnable to defend themſelues from the iniuries of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, either by day or night, &amp; had no other prouiſion of food then the Lord prouided for them after a miraculous maner.</p>
               <p>And this was the miſerable condition of the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, at the day of their birth and deliuerance out of Egypt, the which is excellently and largely deſcribed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> Chap. 16. Out of which baſe eſtate the Lord aduanced them to the greateſt and higheſt dignitie; for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16.</note> that he had led them into the wilderneſſe, hee eſpouſed this people vnto him for his wife, hee loued and protected her, he fed and nouriſhed her, he decked and adorned her, he multiplied his benefits vpon her both ſpirituall and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, induing, and, as it were, endowing her with riches, glorie, pleaſures and all happineſſe; he gaue vnto her his law containing the couenants of marriage betweene them, hee gaue alſo a Prieſthood, a kingdome, a land flowing with milke and honie, a Tabernacle, a Temple, his word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and all things needefull both for ſoule and bodie. But ſhee being ſurfetted with pleaſures, vngratefully forgat <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 14. 15.</note> her former baſe condition, and alſo him who had aduanced her to this great dignitie and happineſſe; and forſaking her Lord and husband who had been thus gratious vnto her, went a whoring after falſe gods: and therefore the Lord is faine to put her in mind of her former wretched eſtate, and to threaten her, that vnleſſe ſhe repented and turned vnto him, he that had raiſed her would pull her downe, and make her as poore, contemptible and miſerable, as when he firſt met and matched with her.</p>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:10737:93"/>
               <p> And this is the firſt compariſon, whereby hee deſcribeth and aggrauateth the miſerie which hee threatneth to bring vpon them. The ſecond is, that he would make her as a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, or the wilderneſſe, as the article prefixed porten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth; where he alludeth to the deſert wilderneſſe, in which the children of Iſrael were led 40. yeeres. Others reſolue it rather thus, <hi>And wil place her as in the wilderneſſe,</hi> that is, bring her into the ſame condition wherein ſhee was in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But the other tranſlation better pleaſeth me, ſeeing it is without addition of any word: and ſeeing it is likely hee threatneth here a farre worſe ſtate then that, which at this time ſhe liued in, becauſe then ſhe inioyed Gods preſence, ſhe was his ſpouſe, ſhe was led and fed, defended and ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Lord her husband. And therefore I thinke rather he threatneth to make her like that wilderneſſe, that is, to make her ſelfe deſert and barraine of all his gifts and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, temporall and ſpirituall, to ſuffer her to be inhabited of her vices and corruptions, as it were with ſo many wild beaſts, to lay her kingdome, countrie and cities waſte like a wilderneſſe, being ouerrunne, burnt and ſpoiled by their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies: as the Lord threatneth, Deut. 28. 51. Leuit. 26. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Deut</hi> 28. 15. <hi>Leuit.</hi> 26. 31. 32<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 31. 32.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he ſaith that hee will leaue her like a drie land, that is, he will depriue her of all her comforts, pleaſures and delights, like a drie and ſchorched ground, where for want of moiſture all the pleaſant herbes and ſweet flowers wither and fade away.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, he threatneth that he will flay her with thirſt, that is, he will ouerwhelme her with the greateſt miſeries; for water is more eaſily come by then foode, and therefore the extremitie of their want is hereby in a liuely manner deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, when as they ſhould want euen water to quench their thirſt, and ſaue their life. Where he alſo alludeth to the ſtate of the Iſraelites in the wilderneſſe, who had no water but what the Lord brought out of a rocke in a miraculous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Neither doth he onely aime at this bodilie thirſt for want of water, but alſo at the thirſt of the ſoule, for want of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:10737:94"/> the water which floweth from the ſanctuarie the word of God, of which <hi>Amos</hi> ſpeaketh, Chap. 8. 11. 13. And of the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 11. 13.</note> water of life, of which whoſoeuer drinketh, ſhall neuer more thirſt, euen the Spirit of God, of which our Sauiour ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: Ioh. 4. 14. 7. 38. 39. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 14 7. 38. 39. The ſcope of the Prophet.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo much for the meaning of the words: wherein the Prophet aimeth at theſe foure things principally: firſt, hee ſetteth forth the admirable and infinite patience, loue, cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie and bountie of God, who when his ſpouſe the Church of Iſrael had often and impudently plaied the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, and for her whoredomes was diuorced from him, yet he did not (according to the iuſt cuſtome of husbands in like caſes) take his gifts and rich benefits from her, which he had beſtowed on her, but ſuffered her to inioy them ſtill: and this he implieth, when as hee willeth her to repent, leſt he ſhould ſpoile her, noting thereby, that as yet hee had not done it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in theſe words he intimateth, that if ſhe would repent, he was readie to forgiue her, and to ſuffer her ſtill to inioy his benefits; for he had not as yet ſpoiled and ſtripped her as he iuſtly might, and was loath to go about it, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he exhorteth her to turne from her ſinnes, that he might not be vrged to doe it in his iuſt diſpleaſure.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he laboureth to worke in her true repentance, by forewarning her of an increaſe of puniſhment, namelie, that if that great puniſhment of diuorce and ſeparation from God would not mooue them to turne from their ſinnes, hee was readie to inflict other puniſhments vpon them, which though they were not ſo great as the former in their owne nature, yet perhaps they were farre more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous in their opinion and apprehenſion. For where hee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth her to take away her ſinnes leſt hee ſpoiled her, hee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth, that vnleſſe ſhe repented, he would not content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with that puniſhment of her diuorce, but would moſt certainely ſpoile her of all the ornaments, gifts and benefits which he had beſtowed on her.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, becauſe pride and true repentance will not ſtand together, therefore he ſeeketh to humble her, both by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:10737:94"/> her in minde of her miſerable and baſe eſtate, wherein ſhe was before hee aduanced her; and by aſſuring her that if ſhe did not humble herſelfe, forſake her ſinnes, and turne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him from her idols, he would leaue her as hee found her, depriue her of all his gifts, and ourwhelme her with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable load of woe and miſery.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the maine things at which the Prophet ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The Do∣ctrines. </seg>
                  </label> in theſe words. The doctrines which from hence are to be obſerued are theſe. Firſt, we may obſerue, what is the <note place="margin">God denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth his iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that we may repent.</note> cauſe why the Lord denounceth his iudgements againſt his people; to wit, that they may repent of their ſinnes, and that repenting they may eſcape puniſhment, which his iuſtice vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth him to inflict vpon them continuing in their ſins. So he cauſeth the diuorce to be proclaimed, that they may take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their adulteries, and that repenting of them, they might not be ſtripped of all the gifts and benefits which as yet they inioyed. So that the end of Gods threatnings is, that we may repent, and of our repentance that wee may eſcape puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the end of one puniſhment is, that making good vſe of it, we may eſcape an other. Whence we may obſerue, that God euen in wrath remembreth mercy; for hee threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that he may not puniſh, and puniſheth that he may not deſtroy; he puniſheth vnwillingly after a ſort, and therefore before hand he giueth warning that wee may eſcape it; and hauing inflicted it, he laboureth to apply it to our ſenſeleſſe hearts, that by our obſtinacy wee doe not vrge his iuſtice to proceede in puniſhing. And therefore let vs not by our ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnneſſe and impenitency make Gods end fruſtrate, and turne mercy into iuſtice; but when he threatneth, let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent that we may eſcape puniſhment; or at leaſt let vs turne vnto him when he puniſheth, that we doe not moue him to deale more ſeuerely with vs.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be obſerued is, that after the Lord <note place="margin">God doth not alwaies ſtrip a people of al his benefits after he hath reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them.</note> hath reiected a people, hee doth not alwaies preſently vpon the diuorce, withdraw his gifts and benefits from them; but leaueth them with them for a time to bee inioyed, that this his loue, patience, and bounty may moue them to forſake
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:10737:95"/> their ſinnes, that ſo they may bee receiued into his former loue and fauour. Whereby, as wee haue occaſion to admire and praiſe the indefatigable patience, and infinite bountie of our gratious God, ſo may we hereby be admoniſhed, not to iudge of Gods loue and fauour, nor of our owne happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe by outward benefits, whether they be ciuill or ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall; as namely, peace, plenty, a flouriſhing eſtate, the word, Sacraments, &amp;c. ſeeing after the diuorce he vouchſafeth to the diuorced ſuch benefits for a time; as appeareth in this place. The like example we haue in <hi>Caine,</hi> who being bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed Gods preſence, flouriſhed in the world: and in <hi>Saul,</hi> who though hee were reiected, yet the Lord ſuffered him a long time to inioy the Kingdome: and in <hi>Ahab,</hi> whoſe deſtruction was long determined before it was effected.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we may obſerue, that becauſe the Church of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael did not repent vpon the hearing of the diuorce procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, <note place="margin">If one iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will not reclaime vs, God will ſend another.</note> therefore the Lord threatneth an other puniſhment, namely, that he would ſtrip and ſpoile them of all his gifts. So that although in his loue and patience he doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after he had diuorced them, depriue them of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, but giueth them a time to make vſe of his former pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; yet his iuſtice will not euer ſuffer him to winke at their ſinnes; but if his firſt iudgement will not reclaime them, he will goe forward to a ſecond, which vſually is more grieuous then the firſt. Notwithſtanding in this he firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth the diuorce, which is the greater puniſhment, and after the withdrawing of his gifts, which is the leſſe; for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from God is infinitely a more heauy iudgement then to be depriued of all other happineſſe. And this hee doth, becauſe howſoeuer theſe things are in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet to worldly men and prophane hypocrites, the loſſe of God is more lightly eſteemed then the loſſe of his gifts; for ſo they may inioy their worldly glory, riches, and delights, they can bee content to liue depriued of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and to be diuorced from him. And therefore the Lord fitteth his ſpeech to them, ſhewing that if this heauy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſeparation from himſelfe, would not touch them
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:10737:95"/> with any ſenſe of their miſery, hee had an other iudgement in ſtore for them, which hee knew they would feelingly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend; to wit, the withdrawing of his gifts and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites from them, which they farre better loued then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we may obſerue, that the abuſe of Gods graces <note place="margin">The abuſe of Gods gifts moueth him to ſtrip vs of them.</note> and benefits, doth moue him iuſtly to ſpoile and ſtrip vs of them; as appeareth here in the example of the Iſraelites: for therefore the Lord ſuffered them to inioy ſtill his gifts, which with a liberall hand hee had beſtowed vpon them, that his mercy and bounty might leade them to repentance, and might mooue them with all earneſtneſſe to ſeeke reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him, who had been ſo good and gratious a God vnto them: but when as contrariwiſe, they the rather for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooke the Lord, &amp; impudently committed ſpirituall whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome with their idols, abuſing Gods benefits as meanes to harten them in their ſinne, and ſpending their wealth vpon their falſe gods, the Lord threatneth that if they would not ſpeedily repent of theſe ſinnes, he would ſtrippe them of his gifts rather then they ſhould be thus abuſed. If therefore we would haue Gods benefits continued vnto vs, let vs take heede that wee doe not abuſe them to pride, wantonneſſe, forgetfulneſſe of God, inſulting ouer our brethren, or by miſpending them vpon any euill vſes to further vs in any ſinne; nay, not onely this, but alſo let vs be carefull to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them well, to Gods glory, the good of our brethren, and for our owne furtherance in all vertue and godlineſſe; for though we doe not abuſe them, yet if with the vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſeruant we hide them in a napkin, and do not vſe them, the Lord will take his talent from vs, and not onely ſtrip vs of his gifts, but alſo caſt vs into vtter darkeneſſe, where ſhall bee weeping and gnaſhing of teeth; as appeareth, Matth. 25. 30. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 30. God putteth vs in minde of our naturall baſeneſſe to humble vs.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, wee may obſerue, that in the Lords threatning, whereby hee indeauoureth to bring the Church of Iſrael to repentance, he putteth them in minde of their former baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, miſerie, and nakedneſſe, not onely to worke in their
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:10737:96"/> hearts a true loue and reuerent reſpect towards him, who from ſuch a contemptible condition had aduanced them to ſuch high dignitie, but alſo to beate downe their pride, with which in reſpect of their preſent proſperitie they were puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed vp, and to humble them with the remembrance of their owne naturall vileneſſe. As if a Prince hauing taken to wife a meane ſeruant, and (perceiuing her to waxe proud and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent towards him, and to neglect him who had aduanced her, ſetting her loue vpon others) ſhould after this manner ſay vnto her: There is no reaſon why thou ſhouldeſt bee ſo proud &amp; inſolent; for howſoeuer I haue now aduanced thee, thou waſt when I found thee poore, baſe and beggarly; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially conſidering that I who haue raiſed thee vp, haue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in my hand to pull thee downe, and to place thee in as baſe condition as thou waſt in former times, if thy prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments puffe thee vp in pride, and moue thee in thy inſolency to neglect and deſpiſe me, who haue been the only cauſe of thine aduancement. And hereby it may appeare how eaſily by Gods grace and bountie we are made inſolent, wanton, and forgetfull of God; how odious a vice this is in Gods ſight, in that he vſeth ſuch meanes to draw vs from it; and that there is no better courſe to bring vs to repentance, then by beating downe this our pride, by calling to minde what we were before the Lord called vs and aduanced vs, namely, baſe, poore and miſerable, deſtitute of all good, and reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with all euill.</p>
               <p>Laſtlie, we may obſerue the manifold miſeries and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, <note place="margin">The miſeries that God brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth on thoſe who forſake his true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</note> which the Lord bringeth vpon thoſe, who forſake his pure worſhip and ſeruice, and giue themſelues ouer to commit idolatrie; for hee not onely diuorceth them from himſelfe, but alſo vnleſſe they repent, he ſtrippeth them of all his gifts and benefits, which he had beſtowed vpon them; he taketh from them the light of their vnderſtanding, and ſuffereth them to be deluded and infatuated in their owne imaginations, as appeareth, Rom. 1. 21. 22. 2. Theſſ. 2. 11. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 21. 22. 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 43.</note> He taketh from them the ſunſhine of his word, and ſuffereth them to walke in darkeneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death; he
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:10737:96"/> ſtrippeth them of al his gifts both of bodie and mind, &amp; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them in their naturall nakedneſſe, defiled with ſin, vglie and deformed; he taketh from them the name of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, children and ſpouſe, and leaueth them as hee found them, the ſlaues of Satan, the children of wrath, and heires of perdition. He maketh them like a deſert wilderneſſe, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of all grace and goodneſſe, and inhabited with their owne luſts, corruptions and paſſions, which like wild beaſts torment and euen rent them in peeces; yea, he maketh whole cities and countries of idolaters waſte and deſolate, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to the common ſpoile of their conquering ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as our Sauiour threatneth the Iewes, Matth. 23. 38. In a word, he depriueth their ſoules of all true ioy and ſound <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 38.</note> comfort, and letteth them periſh in the extremitie of their want. So that the end of idolaters, who hauing knowne God, and do renounce his pure worſhip and ſeruice, is worſe then their beginning, <hi>For better had it been for them not to haue knowne the way of righteouſneſſe, then after they haue knowne it to turne out of it,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 2. Pet. <note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20. 21. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 45.</note> 2. 20. 21. So Matth. 12. 45.</p>

                  <hi>for they be the children of fornications.</hi> In which words are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <note place="margin">The expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</note> two things, firſt the puniſhment, &amp; ſecondly the cauſe thereof. In the firſt we are to conſider, firſt, againſt whom this puniſhment is threatned, &amp; ſecondly, the puniſhment it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The perſons againſt whom this puniſhment is denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, are the children of the adulterous mother; <hi>And I will haue no pitie vpon her children.</hi> Whereas he ſaith, <hi>And I will,</hi> &amp;c. by this connexion he ſignifieth, that vnleſſe his adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſpouſe whom hee had diuorced, would take away her fornications and adulteries by true repentance, he would not content himſelfe with her diuorce and ſpoile, but hee would goe forward in his courſe of iuſt vengeance, to inflict the like
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:10737:97"/> puniſhments vpon her children.</p>
               <p>Where as by mother, we are to vnderſtand in generall the whole Synagogue &amp; Church of Iſrael, eſpecially their magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, ſuperiors &amp; goueruours, both eccleſiaſtical and ciuil; ſo by the children we are to vnderſtand the particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this Church, eſpecially ſubiects and inferiours. For the Lord contenteth not himſelfe with a generall denunciation of his heauy iudgements againſt the whole Church; but he deſcendeth to particulars, and ſpecially applieth his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to euery particular member of this body, that ſo hee may bring the mother and the children, the whole body and the ſeuerall parts, ſuperiours and inferiours vnto true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Superiours when as they conſider, that not onely they themſelues ſhall haue the greateſt meaſure of puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on them, becauſe by their authority and example they haue bin the ringleaders vnto al wickednes; but alſo that the poore people committed to their charge (whom they ought as tenderly to loue as the kinde mother her deare children) ſhal through their bad example and ill gouernment, fall into the like ſins, &amp; ſo be made obnoxious to the like puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. So likewiſe inferiours may be drawne to repentance, when as they conſider that their following of the example of their ſuperiours, and obeying their authority in euil, will not priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods iudgements; but being partakers with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſin, they ſhall alſo be partakers of their puniſhments.</p>
               <p>And ſo much for the perſons. The puniſhment it ſelfe is, that the Lord will haue no mercy or pittie vpon them; not that the Lord will vtterly and abſolutely exclude them from mercy, but onely on this condition, if they perſeuered in their ſinnes without repentance: neither doth hee debarre them of all mercy in regard of their eternall ſaluation, but in reſpect of their temporary reiection, from being his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and children; as may appeare by the latter part of the chapter. The meaning therefore of theſe words is this, that as he had denied to haue pitie vpon the mother, and had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorced her, ſtripped her, and made her like a wilderneſſe, &amp;c. ſo neither would he haue any compaſſion of the children to
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:10737:97"/> to ſpare them; but would bring vpon them the ſame puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he had denounced againſt their mother.</p>
               <p>And this is the puniſhment here denounced. The cauſe moouing the Lord to inflict it is expreſſed in theſe wordes; <hi>For they bee the children of fornications.</hi> In which words is contained a twofold cauſe of the childrens puniſhment: the firſt, becauſe <hi>they are the children of fornications;</hi> that is, the iſſue of an adulterous mother: or more plainely thus; becauſe they are members of an idolatrous Church, who by their gouernours ciuill and eccleſiaſticall are nuzled and nurſed, brought vp and inſtructed in idolatry and a falſe religion.</p>
               <p>The firſt cauſe therefore why the Lord reiecteth the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is in the mother; that is, in the whole Church, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their gouernours and rulers, both eccleſiaſticall and ciuill; becauſe by the former they were taught not a true, but a falſe and idolatrous religion; and by the other were not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from idolatry and falſe worſhip, and vrged to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the true God after a true manner, but rather by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample inticed, and by their authority forced to forſake the true God and follow idols.</p>
               <p>But here it may be demanded, whether the ſinne of the <note place="margin">How God puniſheth the ſinnes of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours in the people.</note> gouernours is a iuſt cauſe to mooue the Lord to puniſh the ſubiects. To which I anſwer, that there are two ſorts of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments: the firſt corporall and temporall: the ſecond, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and eternall. In reſpect of temporall puniſhments, it is iuſt with God to puniſh the ſinnes of parents in children, and of gouernours in the ſubiects; becauſe in reſpect of the whole body, they are parts and members belonging vnto them as the chiefe and principall; and therefore whileſt the children and ſubiects ſuffer puniſhment, the parents and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours are puniſhed in them. 2. Sam. 12. 14. 24. 12. 17. <note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 24. 12. 17.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But in reſpect of ſpirituall and eternall puniſhments, the Lord doth not inflict them vpon the children and ſubiects for the ſinnes of the parents and gouernours poſitiuely, vnleſſe they likewiſe partake with them in their ſinnes, and follow their wicked example; howſoeuer hee may iuſtly for <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 18.</note>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:10737:98"/> their ſins, lay vpon them priuatiue puniſhments, by withhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from them his grace, and the gifts of his holy ſpirit, which he is not bound to giue; of which they being depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, runne into ſinne, and ſo make themſelues obnoxious to poſitiue puniſhments. Now theſe children of which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaketh, were not onely borne of an idolatrous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but alſo they themſelues liued and continued in that idolatry in which they were bred and inſtructed.</p>
               <p>And this is the more principall cauſe why theſe children are puniſhed, becauſe they liked and approued, imbraced and liued in the idolatry of their mother; for not ſimply to haue been the children and members of an idolatrous Church, nor to haue been brought vp and inſtructed in her idolatries, is a cauſe which moueth the Lord to reiect any; if afterwards they hate and forſake the idolatry of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and loue and imbrace the pure and ſincere worſhip of God. The which was the ſtate of many of Gods children in the common apoſtaſie of the Iſraelites; and is the ſtate of many who haue come out of the ſpirituall Babylon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing begotten vnto God by the immortall ſeede of his word.</p>
               <p>But theſe of whom the Prophet ſpeaketh, had not onely in times paſt been, but preſently were the children of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications; they were not onely brought vp in idolatry, but ſtill they liked and liued in it: and this he implieth when as he faith; not that they had been, but preſently were the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of fornication.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of theſe words. The doctrines to be obſerued out of them are theſe. Firſt wee may note, that <note place="margin">That particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the word.</note> the Lord contenteth not himſelfe with a generall denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his iudgements againſt the whole Church of Iſrael; but alſo applieth them ſpecially to the particular members thereof. The which example is to be imitated of Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, eſpecially conſidering that ſuch is the ſelfeloue, pride, hypocriſie, and ſecurity of men, that they will make no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of generall reprehenſions and threatnings vnto themſelues, ſo long as they can ſhift them off, and apply
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:10737:98"/> them vnto others. An example hereof we haue in the ſecure Iſraelites, Eſa. 28. 15. and in the Prieſts and Phariſies: Matth. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 28. 15. <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 41.</note> 21. 41. yea <hi>Dauid</hi> himſelfe made no vſe of the generall para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for his humiliation till it was particularly applied, 2. Sam. 12. 7. And therefore becauſe that which is ſpoken to all, is <note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 7.</note> ſpoken to none; it hath been the cuſtome of all Gods true Prophets and Ambaſſadours, to make particular application of their general doctrines, to the ſpecial vſe of their own hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: ſo <hi>Nathan</hi> to <hi>Dauid,</hi> 2. Sam. 12. 7. <hi>Peter</hi> to the Iewes, <note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 7. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23.</note> Act. 2. 23. all the Prophets to their ſeueral peoples, to whom they were ſent. And this duty is to be performed of all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters, for they are Gods ſtewards, and therefore they are not to ſuffer euery one to ruſh into the ſtorehouſe of Gods word, and to take what pleaſeth them; but they muſt giue euery man <hi>his owne portion in ſeaſon;</hi> as it is, Luke 12. 42. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 42.</note> They are the Churches Surgeons to cure their ſpirituall wounds and ſores of ſinne; and therefore they muſt not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make good plaiſters, but alſo they muſt apply them to their ſores and wounds, for otherwiſe many are ſo ſenſeleſſe that they feele no paine, and therefore deſire no helpe; many ſo wayward and impatient, that they will rather let their ſpirituall wounds putrifie through ſecuritie and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then abide the cure, fearing the plaiſter more then the wound.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee may obſerue, that the idolatry and other grieuous ſinnes of the whole Church, eſpecially of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours <note place="margin">God puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth the ſins of gouernours in the people.</note> both eccleſiaſticall and ciuill, being not repented of, do moue the Lord, not onely to puniſh the whole body, but alſo the particular members; that is, ſubiects and inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, if not with ſpirituall, (as when they are not partakers with them in their ſinnes) yet at leaſt with temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; becauſe being one body, the ſinne of ſuperiours is not onely puniſhed when the puniſhment is inflicted on themſelues, but alſo vpon the inferiours, as being parts of them, and members of the whole body. But beſides corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall afflictions, they make them alſo obnoxious vnto Gods wrath and eternall puniſhments, when as by their falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:10737:99"/> authoritie and euill example, they mooue and allure them, to imbrace their idolatrie and other ſinnes. An exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wherof we haue in the papacie, where becauſe the whole Church is idolatrous, eſpecially their Magiſtrates and Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, therefore priuate men being by their falſe doctrine, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and example nuzled and inſtructed in idolatrie, are together with them diuorced from God, and ouerwhelmed in the common deſtruction. So that the firſt and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote cauſe of this their puniſhment, is in the whole Church and gouernours thereof, the next and immediate cauſe is the idolatrie of euery particular man, which himſelfe committed being ſeduced by the falſe doctrine and euill example of their adulterous mother. The conſideration whereof ſhould make ſuperiours moſt carefull to acquaint themſelues with Gods truth, and to imbrace and profeſſe his true religion, to forſake and deteſt all manner of falſe worſhip and idolatrie, and to auoid all other grieuous and open ſinnes; or if they haue fallen into them ſpeedily to repent of them; ſeeing hereby they do not only draw vpon themſelues the heauieſt meaſure of puniſhment (for the mighty ſhal be mightily tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented) but alſo by their ſins not repented of, do make their <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſubiects, inferiors, &amp; priuate men may here learne, that in reſpect of their religion it is not ſufficient to conforme themſelues to the religion of their gouernours, nor in reſpect of their faith, to beleeue as the Church beleeueth, nor in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their manners to liue according to the example of their ſuperiours, but euery one ought to informe himſelfe of Gods true religion, and to be aſſured out of Gods word, that he worſhippeth the true God after his reuealed will; and to leade his life not according to the example of others, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods precepts, with which he is throughly to be acquainted; for it will not excuſe vs to ſay, that we haue bin ſeduced by falſe teachers, miſlead by ill gouernours, allured by the wicked example of ſuperiours, ſeeing euery man is to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:10737:99"/> liue by their owne faith, to bee directed by his owne know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and to be approoued or condemned by his owne life and actions. And therfore the only priuiledge which he ſhall haue by the falſe religion, idolatrie and wicked examples of his ſuperiors, is, that hauing ſinned with them for company, they ſhall haue their company alſo in ſuffering puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we may here obſerue, that the Lord will not reiect <note place="margin">That former idolatrie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, doth not cauſe God to reiect vs.</note> vs becauſe we haue bin the children of an adulterous mother in time paſt, ſo that we hate and forſake her fornications, and leauing her as an adulterous harlot, do cleaue vnto our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father; for it is not ſaid here that the Lord would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them from his mercie becauſe they had been, but alſo preſently were the children of fornications, that is, not onelie borne of an adulterous harlot, but alſo approouing and following her ſpirituall whoredomes.

Their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie is firſt plainely expreſſed, and afterwards aggrauated. It is expreſſed in theſe words: <hi>For their mother hath plaied the harlot.</hi> Where ſtill he continueth the allegorie, of marriage, adulterie and diuorce; ſhewing and proouing that there was iuſt cauſe why the mother was diuorced, and the children re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, becauſe the mother had plaied the harlot, and ſo her children were an adulterous iſſue. Neither had ſhe only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or after committed whoredome, but euen in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of theſe her children ſhee had conceiued them of the ſeede of fornication; for otherwiſe howſoeuer ſhee was a harlot, yet her children ſhould haue been legitimate, and therefore vnlawfully diſinherited: but they were not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie borne of an harlot, but alſo in adulterie, and therefore they were the children of fornication.</p>
               <p>Now as they are rightly called baſtards, which are not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the lawfull husband, but of the ſeed of a ſtranger: ſo the Lord in reſpect of the ſpirituall generation, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them baſtards which hee hath not begotten by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall ſeede of his word, made powerfull by the inward <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23.</note> opperation of his Spirit. And therefore thoſe who are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten vnto the Church by falſe doctrines and lying ſpirits, and according to their birth are ſo brought vp, they are to be accounted the children of fornications.</p>
               <p>But ſuch was the birth and bringing vp of theſe children, for their mother the Church of Iſrael, vnder the reigne of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Nebat,</hi> committed ſpiritual whoredom, when as forſaking the Lord, ſhee worſhipped the golden calues in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel;</hi> &amp; whileſt ſhe plaied the harlot, the poſteritie which came of her were borne vnto the idols, when as being brought vp in ignorance deſtitute of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge of God and his religion, they were inſtructed in falſe doctrine and idolatrie, and ſo became as groſſe idolaters as their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors. And therefore being in adulterous iſſue of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterous mother, both ſhe and they were iuſtly reiected.</p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:10737:100"/>
               <p> And this was the firſt and chiefe ſinne for which the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was diuorced, and the children diſinherited; namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe plaied the harlot, and the children were begotten in her adultery. Now this their ſinne is aggrauated; firſt by her ſhameleſſe filthineſſe therein ſhewed: and ſecondly, by her impudent and obſtinate reſolution to commit it. The firſt is expreſſed in theſe words; <hi>ſhe that conceiued them hath done ſhamefully.</hi> The Hebrew text hath it; <hi>Shee that conceiued them is affected or confounded with ſhame:</hi> whereby is not meant, that ſhe was ſhamefaſt or aſhamed of her ſinnes; for this agreeth not to the diſpoſition of an harlot, eſpecially to ſuch a ſhameleſſe harlot as this, whoſe fornications were in her face, and her adulteries betweene her breaſts, and who impudently profeſſed that ſhee would goe after her louers, but that ſhe had committed ſuch ſhamefull actions, and had liued ſo filthily and infamouſly, that ſhee had expoſed her ſelfe to all ſhame and reproch. The meaning therefore of theſe words is this, that ſhee had not fallen into her ſinnes of infirmity, or after ſhee was fallen, carried her ſelfe after any moderate manner, but that ſhe often committed theſe ſins, and defiled her ſelfe with ſo many kindes of idolatry and ſuperſtition, that ſhee was growne infamous, and iuſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched of all who heard of or ſaw her abominable fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe.</p>
               <p>Now this hee proueth, and with all further aggrauateth the greatneſſe of her ſinne, by giuing a particular inſtance of her wickedneſſe, in theſe wordes; <hi>for ſhe ſaid, I will goe after my louers,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas he ſaith that ſhe thus ſaid; he impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that ſhee did not follow her louers and forſake the Lord through infirmitie, ignorance, or as one ouertaken at vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares; but aduiſedly, wilfully, vpon a deliberate and ſetled reſolution ſhee determined to doe it; and not onely ſo, but in an impudent manner ſhe profeſſed, that renouncing God her lawfull husband, ſhe would follow her louers.</p>
               <p>Where by her louers, we are to vnderſtand her idols and falſe gods, which are compared fitly vnto louers: for as lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, that is adulterers, allure &amp; intice mens wiues, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:10737:101"/> their hearts from their lawfull husbands, and to fixe it vpon them; to breake their coniugall faith, and to commit whoredome by offering vnto them gifts and pleaſures. So the ſpouſe of God is allured and inticed by idols, to forſake the Lord, and to ſet her heart vpon them, and to violate her mariage ſaith by leauing his pure worſhip and ſeruice, and proſtituting her ſelfe to commit ſpirituall whoredome with them, when as they ſeeme to offer vnto her as a reward, ſome profit or delight.</p>
               <p>And this alſo appeareth in the reaſon which ſhe yeeldeth of her apoſtaſie, in the wordes following: <hi>that giue mee my bread and my water, my wooll and my flaxe, mine oyle and my drinke.</hi> In which words is alſo contained the exceeding great vnthankfulneſſe of the people in aſcribing all the benefits which they inioyed vnto their idols and falſe gods, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Lord alone was the author and fountaine of them. The which their ſinne was ſo much the more vnexcuſable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the Law the Lord had promiſed all theſe gifts vnto them, to the end that they ſhould expect them from him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, &amp; hauing receiued them, they ſhould aſcribe the whole praiſe vnto him onely of his owne gifts: Leuit. 26. 4, 5. Deut. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Leuit.</hi> 26. 4, 5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 2, 3.</note> 28. 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now vnder theſe particulars here named, hee vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all kind of benefits neceſſarie either for their ſuſtenance and preſeruation, or for their pleaſure and delight. For by bread and water in the Scriptures is vſually ſignified all kind of meate and drinke, food and ſuſtenance, as appeareth, Exo. 34. 28. Deut. 23. 4. 1. King. 13. 17. Eſa. 3. 1. By wooll and <note place="margin">

By oyle and drinke is vnderſtood all their pleaſures and delicacies; for oyle in thoſe hot countries was vſed for pleaſure, ornament, ſmell, agilitie and ſtrength: and by drinke is meant not ordinarie drinke, for that hee comprehendeth vnder the name of water, but their drinkes which were moſt coſtly and delicate: and further the word here vſed is of the plurall number, and deriued from ſuch a roote, as ſignifieth to drinke abundantlie, whereby is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:10737:101"/> their plentie of ſuch delicacies.</p>
               <p>And ſo much for the meaning of theſe words. The inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions <note place="margin">Sinne the cauſe of all puniſhment.</note> which hence ariſe are theſe. Firſt, wee may obſerue what was the cauſe of all thoſe puniſhments before denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced both againſt the Church of Iſrael &amp; her children, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie their ſinnes, eſpecially their idolatrie and vnthankfulnes. For becauſe the mother plaied the harlot, and her children were begotten in her adulteries; and not onely ſo, but alſo liked and approoued, imbraced and followed the whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of their mother, therefore ioyning in ſin, they were ioyned in puniſhment. And indeede the ſinne of man is the cauſe of al the miſeries and euils which he ſuffereth, for God who is the chiefe goodneſſe, taketh his delight in doing good, and in multiplying his benefits vpon his creatures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, Pſalm. 145. 9. <hi>The Lord is good to all, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>his mercies are ouer all his workes;</hi> and that of <hi>Micah,</hi> Chap. 7. verſ. 18. <hi>He retaineth not his wrath for euer, becauſe mercie</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mich</hi> 7. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>pleaſeth him.</hi> Neither doth he puniſh but when mens ſinnes vrge his iuſtice, and draw vpon themſelues his iudgements. Whence we learne, when we are puniſhed, not to murmure againſt God, nor to looke to inferiour meanes, but rather to examine our owne conſciences, and to ſearch out our ſins <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 51. 4.</note> which are the cauſe thereof, that ſo we may cleare God and accuſe our ſelues. And likewiſe if we would haue the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remoued, we muſt not vſe euill meanes, for the euill of ſinne will not remooue the euill of puniſhment; nay rather it will redouble it, as being the chiefe cauſe thereof: but if we would haue our puniſhment taken away, let vs firſt take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our ſinnes by vnfained repentance, for if the cauſe bee remoued, the effect will ceaſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we here learne, that the Church doth onely ſo <note place="margin">The Church remaineth the ſpouſe of Chriſt onely ſo long as ſhe keepeth her mariage faith.</note> long remaine the ſpouſe of God as ſhe keepeth her mariage faith, louing and obeying, worſhipping and ſeruing him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loue: but if ſhe plaieth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> harlot, either by forſaking the true God and worſhipping idols, or by ſo worſhipping the true God as ſhe worſhippeth idols; that is, after an idolatrous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, &amp; not after the preſcript rule of his word, this cauſeth the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:10737:102"/> Lord to diuorce her from him, and to ſtrip her of al his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits. So that it is not ſufficient for a Church, that ſhe hath been the ſpouſe of Chriſt, that ſhe hath plighted he faith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and worſhipped him according to his word, vnleſſe ſhe perſeuere in her faithfulneſſe, loue, and ſincere and pure obedience; for this was the eſtate of the Iſraelites who were diuorced for their apoſtaſie. So that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth in vaine pretend her long continuance and ſucceſſion of Biſhops, to prooue her ſelfe to be the ſpouſe of Chriſt: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they haue made an apoſtaſie, breaking their faith, forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Gods pure worſhip, and imbracing their owne will-worſhippes and inuentions, worſhipping in ſtead of the true God, their breaden god, Saints, Angels, croſſes, crucifixes and images. And therefore hauing plaied the harlots, the mother together with the children, they were long agoe diuorced from God, and ſtripped of his ſpirituall benefits.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we may obſerue, that after men haue forſaken the <note place="margin">No modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie and wil-worſhip.</note> Lord and his pure worſhip, and giuen themſelues ouer to commit idolatrie, they can containe themſelues in no mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but behaue themſelues moſt ſhamefully, infinitly mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying their ſuperſtitions, and kindes of idolatrie, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the varietie of euery mans inuention. An example wherof we haue in the old Egyptians, in the Gentiles, Rom. 1. In the Papiſts at this day, whoſe idolatries are manifold, and their ſuperſtitions innumerable: for they do not only make Idols, but they alſo worſhip them, by kneeling and praying vnto them, offering vnto them incenſe and oblations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating vnto them Churches, going on pilgrimage, aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing vnto them power to doe miracles and forgiue ſins. The conſideration whereof ſhould make vs moſt carefully to auoid all wil-worſhip, and to reſtraine our ſelues vnto that worſhip which God hath reuealed in his word.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, wee may obſerue the impudencie of idolaters, <note place="margin">The impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters.</note> and their reſolued obſtinacie in their ſinnes: for they do not only fall of ignorance and infirmitie, nor content themſelues with their idolatries in ſecret committed, but like ſhameleſſe harlots they make a trade and open profeſſion of their ſins,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:10737:102"/> not ſticking openly to ſay that they will follow their louers. An example whereof we haue in this place, as alſo in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, who not only in ſecret, but alſo in their Churches, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket places and open proceſſions beare about their Idols, and make open profeſſion of their idolatrie and apoſtaſie.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, wee may here obſerue the palpable ignorance and <note place="margin">The ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters.</note> wilfull blindneſſe, the groſſe ingratitude, and carnall world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of idolaters; their ignorant blindneſſe, in aſcribing their proſperitie and plentie vnto their ſinne of worſhipping Idols, which is the cauſe of their miſerie, pouertie and naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; their vnthankfulneſſe, in attributing the praiſe of all thoſe benefits which they enioy, through the free mercie and bountie of God, vnto their louers, that is, their Idols and falſe gods, which are no cauſes of their bleſſings, but of their puniſhments; their carnall worldlineſſe, in that they make choice of their religion, not for the loue of God and of his truth, but for worldly benefits, pleaſures and preferments. So the idolaters heere in their ignorance and vnthankfulneſſe aſcribe their riches and pleaſures to their louers, profeſſing that therefore they will follow them, becauſe they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited by them. Thus they aſcribed their deliuerance out of Egypt to the golden Calfe, Exod. 32. 4. and to their Calues in Dan and Bethel, 1. King. 12. 28. Thus the men of Iudah im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 4. 1. <hi>King.</hi> 12. 28.</note> and ſtubbornely refuſed to heare the word of the Lord, by the mouth of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> and ſtifly affirmed that they would doe ſacrifice to the Queene of Heauen, becauſe whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt they committed this idolatrie, they had plentie of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, and were well and felt none euill, &amp;c. Iere. 44. 17. 18. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iere.</hi> 44. 17. 18.</note> 19. And thus many in theſe daies, through their groſſe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and vnthankfulneſſe, approue and iuſtifie, like and liue in the idolatrous religion of the Papiſts, becauſe whileſt they worſhipped the Queene of Heauen, the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and their Saints and Images, they had plentie of victuals, and all things good cheape. But as the Apoſtle ſaith of ſuch, <hi>Their end is damnation, whoſe god is their bellie, and whoſe glorie is to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>their ſhame, which minde earthly things,</hi> Philip. 3. 19. Thus alſo doe they offend, who aſcribe the benefits which they enioy,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:10737:103"/> not to the free mercie and bountie of God, but to their owne wits, induſtrie and labour, ſacrificing to their owne nets, and burning incenſe vnto their yearne, becauſe by them their portion is fat, and their meate plenteous, as the Prophet <hi>Habacuc</hi> ſpeaketh, Hab. 1. 16. But moſt grieuouſly of all in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 16.</note> this reſpect doe the Papiſts offend, who rob and ſpoile the Lord of the praiſe of his gifts, by aſcribing almoſt euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular benefit which they enioy, to ſome Saint or Idoll, as the peculiar patrone, author, and preſeruer thereof, vnto whom they pray and goe on pilgrimage, when they ſtand in need of any of theſe benefits, and vnto whom they offer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and praiſes when they abound with them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, as it is the nature and diſpoſition of idolaters, out <note place="margin">Idolaters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion by their proſperitie.</note> of their religion to ſeeke their gaine and profit, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to eſteeme that religion beſt and trueſt, whereby they may reape vnto themſelues the greateſt harueſt of worldly benefit; ſo if they be put to the proouing and iuſtifying of their religion, the maine argument which they commonly vſe for this purpoſe, is their worldly proſperitie, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of pleaſures, riches and preferments, thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues moſt approoued of God, and their religion moſt true when they moſt abound in theſe worldly things. This wee ſee in this place, in the example of the Iewes in the time of <hi>Ieremie,</hi> Iere. 44. 17. 18. And in the Papiſts at this day, who <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iere.</hi> 44. 17.</note> approue their religion, by the outward pompe and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of their Church, eſpecially of their Pope, Cardinals and Biſhops.</p>

The parties are thoſe amongſt the idolatrous Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, who (though they were not yet called) belonged to Gods election: for though the Prophets ſpeech be directed to all thoſe idolatrous Iſraelites, who ſaid, <hi>I will go after my louers:</hi> yet it is to be vnderſtood Synecdochically, of thoſe alone amongſt them, whom it was Gods purpoſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert &amp; ſaue. For not only the reprobate, but alſo the elect fall into this ſin of idolatrie, ſometimes of ignorance, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of infirmity, being either drawne with feare, or allured by profit, pleaſure or preferme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: &amp; ſuch were theſe vnto who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Prophet ſpeaketh, who ſaid y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they would go after their louers, telling them, that the Lord would croſſe them in their reſolution, and ſtay them in the middeſt of their courſe.</p>
               <p>And that it is to be vnderſtood of the elect onely, it may appeare, firſt, becauſe the Lord doth not lay thornes in the way of the reprobate, to diſcourage and hinder them from their idolatrie, and other wickedneſſe, but leaueth them to their owne wils and luſtes, to run on without impediment in the broad way, which leadeth to deſtruction; but he croſſeth thoſe in their wicked deſignes, who belong to his election, and either firſt or laſt he hindereth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their wicked waies, not ſuffering them to run on in their courſe of ſin, into which their corrupt fleſh leadeth them. Secondly, it is ſaid in the 7. verſ. that being thus croſſed in their purpoſes, they ſhould, hauing come to a ſenſe and feeling of their miſerie, returne vnto the Lord by true repentance; which cannot bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the reprobate idolaters, but only of the elect.</p>
               <p>And ſo much for the perſons. In the puniſhment it ſelfe is expreſſed, firſt the cauſe thereof, ſecondly the qualitie of the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:10737:104"/> puniſhment, thirdly, the end why it is inflicted. The cauſe in theſe words, <hi>Therfore behold:</hi> which haue relation to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verſe, and point out the ſin, which was the cauſe of this puniſhment; as though he ſhould ſay, Becauſe you haue bin ſo obſtinate &amp; impudent in your idolatries, as that you haue not ſtucke to ſay openly, that you would ſtill go after your louers, therefore you ſhall not haue your wils, nor be able to performe your wicked purpoſes; for I will lay thornes in your way, and ſo hinder you, that you ſhall not go forward in your courſe.</p>
               <p>The qualitie of the puniſhment is expreſſed in theſe words: <hi>I will hedge thy way with thornes, and make a wall;</hi> (for ſo the originall text readeth.) Where he continueth the allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ſhewing, that if they like harlots, wander abroad, and run after their louers; he will keepe a more ſtraite watch ouer them, and reſtraine them, will they nill they, from gadding abroad: or elſe (which I rather think) he alludeth to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of husbandmen, who when their beaſts will not keep in their owne paſture, do make ſtrong their fence, and hedge them in; and if this wil not containe them, they make walles of mud or ſtone, to make them ſure for leaping ouer. So the Lord threatneth, that if they will not bee contained in his Church, but wil leap ouer vnto their Idols and falſe gods, he will prouide a hedge, and a wall to keep them in.</p>
               <p>Now this hedge of thornes and ſtrong wall, of which he ſpeaketh, are croſſes and afflictions, as the diſeaſes of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, ſorrow of mind, warre, famine, pouertie and ſuch like, which are compared to thornes: for as when thornes lie in our way, they prick, moleſt and grieue vs, keeping vs from going forward, vnleſſe it be with great paine and difficultie: ſo in the way of our pilgrimage, theſe thornes of afflictions vex and trouble vs, by tormenting the bodie, and wounding the minde. And in this ſenſe is the word taken, Ioſ. 23. 13. where the Lord threatneth, that the curſed nations, whom <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joſh.</hi> 23. 13.</note> the Iſraelites had not caſt out, ſhould be as whippes on their ſides, and thornes in their eyes, that is, cauſes of their great affliction and moleſtation. So Ezech. 28. 24. The Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 28. 24.</note>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:10737:104"/> that the Zidonites ſhould be no more a pricking thorne to the houſe of Iſrael. Whereas therefore the Lord threatneth, that he would ſtop their way with thornes, and with a wall, the meaning is, that he would keepe them from following their Idols, by afflictions; and if leſſer afflictions would not containe them, he would inflict vpon them ſuch grieuous calamities, as like a ſtrong wall ſhould keep them in and hinder them from following their falſe gods. By which, as he vnderſtandeth in generall, all the afflictions and miſeries which he ſent amongſt them; ſo eſpecially, their ſiege and captiuitie by the Aſſyrians: for when they were beſieged by them, and when being vanquiſhed, they were led away captiue; then they were hedged in, and compaſſed with a ſtrong wall, ſo as they could not as in former times, go to worſhip their golden calues in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The end why the Lord thus dealeth wirh them, is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in theſe words, <hi>That ſhe ſhould not find her pathes:</hi> wherby is meant, that the Lord would therefore hedge and wall them in with afflictions, that they ſhould not go forward in their ordinarie courſe of committing idolatrie: the which is called her pathes, becauſe, as by often going in the ſame way, a path is made by the continuall treading of mens feet; ſo ſhee ſo vſually and commonly frequented her Idols, that her idolatries ſeemed as her path and common way, wherin ſhe daily and continually walked.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of theſe words. The inſtructions <note place="margin">God ſtoppeth the elect in the courſe of their ſin, with the hedge of afflictions.</note> that we are to gather out of them, are theſe. Firſt, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that howſoeuer the Lord doth often ſuffer the wicked and reprobate to goe forward in their ſinnes, without any check and controlement, and to haue a proſperous courſe, and wiſhed ſucceſſe in their wicked deſignes, without any let or hinderance; yet he dealeth not thus with thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto his election: but if they, through the corruption of the fleſh, either of ignorance, or of infirmitie, reſolue to proſecute wicked courſes, though he may ſuffer them for a time, yet in the end he will lay in their way the thornes of croſſes and afflictions, to hinder them from atchieuing their
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:10737:105"/> wicked ends; that ſo being ſtayed, they may returne backe againe vnto him by true repentance. So he ſuffered the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to go forward without ſtop, in their idolatries: but when the Iſraelites forſooke him, and followed idols, he laid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually thornes of affliction in their way, to cauſe them to deſiſt in their courſe, and to returne vnto him, as appeareth in the hiſtorie of the Iudges, and the Kings: the like examples we haue in <hi>Ionas,</hi> in <hi>Dauid,</hi> 2. Sam. 11. 12. in reprobate <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.</note> and elect <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> in the Scribes and Phariſies, and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 9. in the rich Glutton, &amp; the prodigall <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 9. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.</note> ſonne, Luk. 15. &amp; 16. Whereby it appeareth, that the Lord will not ſuffer thoſe which belong vnto him, to be ſo euill as they would be: but when they reſolue to go forward in ſin, he layeth in their way a hedge of thornie afflictions, either trouble of mind, or ſicknes, or loſſe in their ſtate, that ſo they may not go on in the pathes of ſinne, but returne againe by true repentance. Whence wee may gather a notable ſigne, whether we belong to Gods election, or be in the number of the reprobate; for if wee go forward in our wicked courſes, without ſtop or hinderance, with eaſe and proſperitie, it is a ſigne that wee belong not to God, for then he would not ſuffer vs to go on in the way of perdition: but if we no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner reſolue vpon ſome wicked deſigne, but ſtraight we are either croſſed in it, or afterward afflicted, that we cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in it as we purpoſed, ſurely it is a ſigne that the Lord hath a care of vs, in that he holdeth vs backe from running headlong to euerlaſting deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe, though the Lord lay theſe thornes in our way, yet through our negligence and ſecuritie, though <note place="margin">We do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Gods hand in our afflictions.</note> we ſee the hedge, and feele the prickes of affliction, pearcing our ſoules and bodies, we oftentimes neither conſider who hath ſet this hedge in our way, nor for what cauſe, but are readie to aſcribe our afflictions to chance and fortune, to our owne want of prouidence, to the malice of our enemies, or ſome ſecondarie cauſe; therefore the Lord willeth them to behold, and to conſider, that he it was that ſet this hedge in their way, and for this cauſe, in that they had reſolued to go
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:10737:105"/> forward in their ſinnes, that knowing the meritorious cauſe of their puniſhment to be their ſinnes, they might labour to take them away by true repentance; and knowing the Lord to be the author of them, they might humble themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand, and implore mercie and forgiueneſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we may here learne, that it is impoſſible for Gods elect to periſh, for he will not ſuffer them to goe on in ſin to their perdition; yea though they will deſire and reſolue to liue in wickedneſſe, the Lord will finde meanes to pull them out of it: for his will is aboue their wils, his eternall purpoſe and decree, which is vnchangeable, cauſeth a change in their wicked deſignes and vnlawfull purpoſes, ſo that they ſhall not atchieue them according to their ſetled reſolutions: as we may ſee in the example of <hi>Ionas, Dauid, Paul,</hi> and many others. So that Gods elect may certainly be aſſured, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſinnes are inſufficient, therefore nothing elſe is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall to ſeparate them from the loue of God in Chriſt Ieſus. Rom. 8. 38. 39.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, here we learne moſt carefully to take heed, that <note place="margin">We muſt not leape ouer the hedge of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> we doe not when the Lord ſetteth this hedge in our way to reſtraine vs from ſinne, leap ouer it: for if the fence bee not ſtrong enough hee will make it ſtronger, and in ſtead of an hedge he will ſet a wall to reſtraine vs, that is, if lighter affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions will not withhold and ſtay vs from going forward in the courſe of ſinne, he will inflict thoſe which are heauier and more intolerable.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, wee may here obſerue the great benefit which our afflictions cauſe vnto vs, for they ſerue for ſharpe thornie <note place="margin">Afflictions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain vs from ſinne.</note> hedges &amp; ſtrong walles to containe vs in the waies of Gods commandements, and to keep vs from leaping ouer into the pleaſant paſtures of ſinne and wickedneſſe, where we ſhould but bee fatted to the ſlaughter; the Lord laieth in our way theſe thornie afflictions, not to kill vs, but to prick vs, and by pricking to reſtraine vs from going the broad way that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to deſtruction: for when we are thus <hi>iudged, we are cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened of the Lord, becauſe wee ſhould not be condemned with the world,</hi> 1. Cor. 11. 31. He correcteth vs not becauſe he hateth <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 31.</note>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:10737:106"/> vs, but becauſe hee entirely loueth vs, euen as his owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; not for our hurt, but <hi>for our profit, that we might be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of hie holineſſe,</hi> Heb. 12. 7. 10. And though <hi>no chaſtening</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 7. 10. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>ſeemeth to be ioyous, but grieuous for the preſent: yet afterwards it bringeth the quiet fruit of righteouſneſſe vnto them which are thereby exerciſed,</hi> Heb. 12. 11. Though theſe afflictions be bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and vnpleaſant to the fleſh, yet are they profitable to the ſpirituall part: for whileſt the <hi>outward man periſheth, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man is renued daily,</hi> 2. Cor. 4. 16. Though theſe thornes <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 16.</note> pricke vs, yet they doe not mortally wound vs, only they let out the winde of vainglorie, and humble vs that wee be not exalted out of meaſure. Though they ſeeme tedious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7.</note> and tending to our deſtruction, yet in truth they are but light and momentanie, and cauſe vnto vs a ſuperex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and eternall waight of glorie: 2. Cor. 4. 17. <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But yet wee are not to imagine that affliction in it owne <note place="margin">Afflictions not good in themſelues, but through Gods bleſſing.</note> nature worketh al theſe benefits; but by the ſecret operation of Gods Spirit inwardly applying it vnto our hearts, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vs to make a holy vſe of it: for ſuch is our obſtinate ſtubbornneſſe, that wee will like vntamed and wilde beaſts ruſh thorow this hedge of afflictions, that we may ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue our courſe in ſinne: and ſuch is our ſenſeleſneſſe in our ſecuritie, that either we feele not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pricking of theſe thornes, or at leaſt are not by the ſmart moued to ſorrow for ſinne, as being the cauſe thereof; or to flee vnto God by true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that wee may haue eaſe, vnleſſe the Spirit worke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with our afflictions, making them effectuall for theſe purpoſes. As wee may ſee in the example of <hi>Saul, Ieroboam,</hi> 1. King. 14. 1. 2. the Iſraelites, Eſa. 1. 5. and in our owne late experience.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <p>ANd ſo much concerning the puniſhment denounced. The effect of this puniſhment in the people is twofold. The firſt is expreſſed in theſe words: <hi>And ſhe ſhall follow her</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſ. </seg>7</label> 
                  <hi>louers, and ſhall not come at them; and ſhe ſhall ſeeke them, and ſhall not finde them,</hi> &amp;c. In which words are contained two things: firſt, the behauiour of theſe idolaters, when as God <note place="margin">The expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:10737:106"/> had hedged them in with the hedge of afflictions, namely, they follow and ſeeke after their louers, and that with great anxietie of mind, care and earneſt endeuour; for ſo the word here vſed ſignifieth. The ſecond is, that God maketh fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate all their labour, ſo as they follow and ſeeke after them in vaine.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after theſe idolaters were afflicted for their ſinnes, and ſo hedged in with troubles and inextri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable miſeries, that they could not tell what courſe to take, nor which way to turne themſelues; yet they doe not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently turne vnto the Lord and repent of their ſinnes, nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they endeuour to flee from him, and to ſeeke helpe of their Idols; and as though all theſe afflictions had betided them, becauſe they had been no more zealous and deuout in their ſuperſtition and idolatrie, therefore they double their diligence, and with greater care and endeuour they worſhip and ſerue their Idols, hoping and expecting deliuerance from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as a reward of all their paines.</p>
               <p>Wherein the Prophet alludeth to the practiſe of adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wiues, who when they are reſtrained in their wicked courſes by their husbands iealous and watchfull eye, or by ſome rougher and ſtricter courſe, doe not preſently forſake their louers and amend, but rather ſtudie and inuent out meanes how they may eſcape out of their husbands cuſtodie and againe come into their louers companie: or elſe to the manner of beaſts and cattell, who being reſtrained with a new fence from their old haunt, do not preſently feed quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their owne paſture, but range along by the hedge ſide to finde a gap, or ſome eaſie place where they may leap ouer or burſt thorow into thoſe fields into which they haue ranged in former times: ſo this idolatrous ſpouſe being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained with the chaſtiſements of her husband from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Idols, doth not at firſt forſake her ſinne, and turne vnto the Lord by true repentance, but with greater madneſſe ſhe endeuoureth to proceede in her adulteries, ſuperſtitions and idolatrie, and ſeeketh help of her louers and Idols, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:10737:107"/> ſhe may be freed from thoſe afflictions which God hath laid vpon her.</p>
               <p>So that here the ſinne of theſe idolaters is further aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated, in that they made no vſe of Gods afflictions, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther behaued themſelues more impudently then in former times: for whereas this adulterous ſpouſe though ſhe were reſolued to liue in vncleanneſſe, yet rather ſhould haue been ſought vnto by her louers, then to ſeeke after them, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to all womanhood ſo farre exceeded the bounds of modeſtie, being tranſported with the blind furie of her luſt, followeth after them when ſhee is neglected, and ſeeketh them when ſhe is not ſought.</p>
               <p>But here it may be demanded, how ſhe can be ſaid to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and ſeeke after her louers, when as hee ſaith in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verſe that ſhe was ſo hedged and walled in that ſhe could not finde her paths? I anſwere, that he here deſcribeth, <hi>potiùs adulterae affectum quàm profectum,</hi> rather the affection then the action of this harlot; it is true that ſhe could not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto her deſire, but ſtill notwithſtanding ſhe deſireth; ſhe was hedged in, but neuertheleſſe ſhe wandreth about to finde a gap; ſhe could not indeed finde or come at her lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, but yet ſhe rangeth in the purſuite, and ſeeketh to come into their companie.</p>
               <p>And this appeareth by the ſecond point which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, namely, the fruſtrating of her labour: for it is ſaid, that though ſhee followed her louers, yet ſhee ſhould not come at them; though ſhe ſought them with all care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, yet ſhe ſhould not find them. In which words, the Lord ſheweth, that though this adulterous ſpouſe, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamed heifer, would endeuour to break thorow the hedge of afflictions, which he had ſet about her, to the end that ſhee might againe with like proſperitie, as in former times, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her louers, and liue in her whoredomes; yet ſhe ſhould not be able to accompliſh her deſire; though ſhe ſhould ſeek her Idols, with more then ordinarie deuotion, praying, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering vnto them ſacrifices and oblations, to the end, that by
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:10737:107"/> their helpe ſhe might be freed out of her afflictions, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto her former proſperitie, which in her blind igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſuperſtition ſhe aſcribed vnto them, yet ſhe ſhould ſpend all her labour in vaine, ſeeing her Idols ſought ſhould not be found, that is, ſhe ſhould not find them any waies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to remoue her afflictions, or to helpe her out of her miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and diſtreſſe.</p>
               <p>Wherby he aggrauateth the wretchednes of her eſtate, and in a moſt liuely maner ſetteth forth the deſperatenes of her miſerie. For though one be in miſerie and diſtreſſe, yet if they haue hope that they may haue acceſſe to ſuch friends, vnto whom when they haue made knowne their caſe, they ſhall finde them both able and willing to releeue them; this is a ſtrong argument to worke in them patience: but if either they cannot come at them, whom they moſt truſt and relie vpon, or elſe find them altogether vnable to do them any good, then the fruſtrating of their hope being added to the waight of their miſerie and afflictions, ouerwhelmeth and preſſeth them downe, and maketh their burthen vnſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
               <p>And this is the firſt effect of the Churches afflictions. The ſecond is expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>Then ſhall ſhe ſay, I will go and returne to my first huſband, for at that time was I better then now.</hi> In which words is contained the Churches repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the reaſon mouing her hereunto. The firſt is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in theſe words, <hi>Then ſhall ſhe ſay, I will go and returne vnto my first huſband:</hi> that is, after ſhe ſeeth her ſelfe croſſed in her wicked courſes, and ſo hedged in with afflictions, that ſhe cannot follow her Idols, and enioy her former proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, after ſhe hath long in vaine ſought for helpe and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance at the hands of her Idols, and hath now no hope by their meanes, either to come out of her preſent miſerie, or to enioy her former proſperitie, being deſtitute of all other helpe; then ſhe ſhall ſay, that is, ſhe ſhall reſolue and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, yea and alſo profeſſe this her purpoſe and reſolution, that ſhe would no longer ſit ſtill in this miſerie, and ſuffer her ſelfe to be ſwallowed vp of griefe, and deſperation; but ſhee
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:10737:108"/> would go, and forſaking her louers, and adulterous Idols, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto her firſt husband, who indeed alone deſerued the name of a husband, ſeeing the other were but louers, ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and adulterers.</p>
               <p>The reaſon mouing her to make this returne vnto her husband, is expreſſed in theſe words: <hi>For at that time was I better then now:</hi> that is, I will now at length forſake theſe Idols, and returne vnto the Lord, becauſe I plainly ſee, and ſenſiblie diſcerne, that my ſtate and condition was farre bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and more happie, when I cleaued vnto the Lord, my on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true husband, with all my heart, louing, ſeruing, and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him alone, and performing vnto him that pure and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere worſhip, which is deſcribed in his word, then it hath bin ſince I forſook him, and proſtituted my ſelf, to commit ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall vncleanneſſe with Idols: for by this my apoſtaſie I haue moued my louing husband, in his iuſt diſpleaſure to reiect me, &amp; to ſtrip me of al thoſe benefits which he had beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on me: I haue depriued my ſelf of al true comfort, ioy and peace of conſcience, and am now filled with horror, feare, and anguiſh of mind; and I haue plunged my ſelfe into a ſea of miſerie, and innumerable afflictions, out of which my lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, in whom I truſted, and whoſe helpe I haue implored, cannot deliuer me. And therefore what remaineth, but that I forſake my louers, and my ſinnes with them committed, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are miſerable comforters in my greateſt need, and diſtreſſe, and returne and reconcile my ſelfe vnto my huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who is infinite in mercie and compaſſion?</p>

Firſt, we may obſerue the ſuperſtitious blindnes of idolaters, who, when the Lord pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth <note place="margin">Idolaters in their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, flie vnto their Idols, and not vnto God.</note> them for their idolatries, do not repent of their ſins, and returne vnto the Lord, crauing mercie, forgiuenes, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe of their puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: but rather, haue their recourſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Idols, with more then ordinarie deuotion: ſeruing them with their Pilgrimages, Vowes, Inuocations, Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and other rites and ceremonies, wherewith they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they may be beſt pleaſed; ſuppoſing that their ſlacknes
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:10737:108"/> and remiſſenes in theſe ſuperſtitious deuotions, hath bin the cauſe of all their afflictions: whereas in truth their ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and idolatrie, is the chiefe cauſe of all their miſeries, and therefore the multiplying of them doth not releaſe them of their puniſhment, but rather redoubleth it. An example whereof we haue in this place, in <hi>Micha,</hi> Iudg. 17. 13. <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah,</hi> 2. King. 1. 2. and in the Papiſts, who when the Lord <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Judg.</hi> 17. 13. 2. <hi>King.</hi> 1. 2.</note> puniſheth them for their idolatries, ſeeke freedome and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance from the euils they ſuffer, by their vowes, pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, prayers, and oblations to their Idols and Images; as though they could drie themſelues being wet, by leaping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a riuer, or eaſe themſelues being burnt, by leaping into the fire, Eſay 1. 28. 29. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſay</hi> 1. 28. 29. Our naturall pronenes to Idolatrie.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, we may obſerue our naturall proneneſſe vnto idolatrie, for not only we eaſilie fall into it, but being fallen, we are hardly recouered and recalled from this ſinne: no, though the Lord to his word ſhewing his truth, and the falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and abominablenes of idolatrie, do alſo adde his rods of afflictions, that at leaſt ſenſe of paine may make vs wearie of our ſinnes. And therefore it is not to be wondered at, that the moſt part of the world do forſake Gods pure worſhip, and liue in idolatrie, ſeeing mans nature is ſo inclined there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that though he ſmart for it, he will not leaue it: and how much more then will he embrace it, when he is allured and drawne vnto that, which of his owne nature he is prone vnto, by pleaſures, profit, and preferments? for the Lord doth not hedge in all with afflictions, which reſolue to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their louers, but onely thoſe, whom it is his purpoſe to conuert, as belonging to his eternall election.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we may obſerue that affliction in it ſelfe, is not ſufficient to make vs forſake our ſins, and to turne vnto the <note place="margin">Affliction, if it be not ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, doth not turne vs vnto God.</note> Lord by true repentance, vnleſſe it bee ſanctified and made effectuall for this purpoſe, by the inward working of Gods Spirit. For though the Lord had hedged his people in with afflictions, that they might not goe forward in their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: yet it is ſaid heere, that notwithſtanding all this, they the more followed and ſought after their louers. So <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:10737:109"/> the more hee was puniſhed the more hee was hardened, the more the children of Iſrael were afflicted in the wilderneſſe, the more they murmured; the more they were ſmitten, the more they fell away, Eſai. 1. 5. But I ſhall not need to go far <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſai.</hi> 1. 5.</note> for examples, ſeeing wee haue a preſent example amongſt our ſelues, who haue made no vſe of Gods late viſitation, &amp;c. And therefore when we are afflicted, let vs earneſtly deſire the Lord to ſanctifie our afflictions vnto vs, and to ioyne with his outward corrections, the inward working of his Spirit, whereby we may be moued to lay them to heart, and to humble our ſelues vnder the hand of God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, wee may obſerue the corrupt nature of ſinfull <note place="margin">Corrupt man ſeeketh all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes, before he fli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto God.</note> man, who when he is in trouble and affliction, aſſayeth all other meanes for his deliuerance, before he flieth vnto God for helpe: ſo here the Iſraelites being hedged in with affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, flee vnto their Idols. So <hi>Saul</hi> went to the witch, <hi>Aſa</hi> to the Phyſitions, the Papiſts to their Saints and Images. And thus many make gods vnto themſelues, for their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance, of their friends, riches, or of their owne power and policie: when as being in trouble and affliction they do not in the firſt place flee vnto the Lord for helpe, but reſt vpon theſe meanes, vntill they be altogether depriued of them, or haue experience of their inſufficiency in yeelding vnto them any helpe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we may obſerue, that the Lord taketh from thoſe, <note place="margin">God fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth other meanes, that we may reſt vpon him.</note> which he purpoſeth to conuert and ſaue, all theſe Idols in whom they truſt, and theſe outward meanes wherupon they reſt, or at leaſt, teacheth them by lamentable experience, that they are altogether inſufficient to deliuer them out of their afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. So he threatneth here, that his elect people follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after their louers, ſhould not come at them, and ſeeking them (to the end they might be by their helpe deliuered out of their afflictions) they ſhould not find them, that ſo being made fruſtrate of their wicked hopes, and abandoned of all outward meanes, wherein they truſted, and deſpairing of all other helpe, might hereby be driuen to flee vnto the Lord for mercie and deliuerance. And therefore, when being in
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:10737:109"/> affliction, or any diſtreſſe, we are diſappointed of our hopes, and depriued or forſaken of thoſe meanes, wherein we tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted for deliuerance; let vs perſwade our ſelues, that the Lord hereby doth chaſtiſe our vaine confidence and carnall affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, whereby we truſt and reſt vpon, rather the creature, then vpon him our Creator; and withall doth beate vs from thoſe worldly hopes, that we might flee vnto him for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, and reſt vpon his promiſes and prouidence for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the doctrines which ariſe out of the former <note place="margin">God doth not ſuffer his to remaine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in their ſinne and ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie.</note> part of this verſe, containing the firſt effect of the peoples af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. Now out of the latter part, wherein is ſhewed the ſecond effect, namely, their forſaking their Idols, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto the Lord, theſe inſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are further to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we learne, that howſoeuer thoſe that belong to Gods election, may for a time leaue Gods pure worſhip, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Idols, yea and be ſo blinded in their ſuperſtitions, that when they are afflicted for their ſinne, they doe with more earneſtnes embrace idolatrie; yet the Lord will not ſo leaue them, but at length he will open their eyes, that they ſhal ſee their ſinnes, and ſenſiblie diſcerne that they are the cauſes of their puniſhments; though for a time in their ignorance and ſuperſtition they preferre idolatrie before his true worſhip, yet at laſt he illuminateth their iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, ſo as they may ſee how much better it is to follow him, then to follow idols, to embrace his true religion reuealed in his word, then to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their owne inuention. Examples hereof we haue in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> in the Iſraelites comming out of Egypt, and in the time of the Iudges, and in many at this day, who haue forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the idolatries of the whore of Babylon, and haue em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced Gods true religion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we may obſerue, that as ſoone as they ſpie their <note place="margin">As ſoone as the faithfull ſee their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and ſins, they reforme and forſake them.</note> errors, they do not go on further in them, but they returne into the way of truth; as ſoone as they ſee their ſins they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them, as being the cauſes of their miſerie; when they ſee the vainenes of their idols, then they returne vnto the Lord
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:10737:110"/> their true husband, neitheir is it enough to ſee our ſins, if wee continue in them, nay rather this will redouble our puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; it is not ſufficient to know truth and error, vnleſſe we <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 47.</note> embrace the one, and forſake the other: it will not profit vs to ſee our former groſſeneſſe in following idols, vnleſſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 21.</note> hereby we be moued, not only to forſake them, but alſo to returne vnto our husband, the Lord our God, worſhipping him according to his will. So that here we learne what is the practiſe of true repentance, it conſiſteth not in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge only, or acknowledgment of our ſins, for thus far did <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> proceed, thus did <hi>Iudas,</hi> and thus do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worldlings repent: but we muſt ſo ſee our ſinnes, as that with the ſight of them, wee bee exceedingly diſpleaſed with our ſelues; we muſt ſo acknowledge them, as that withall we vnfainedly bewaile them; we muſt when we behold them, alſo hate and deteſt them, and not only forſake our ſins, but alſo returne vnto the Lord, with full purpoſe of heart, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and endeuouring to ſerue and pleaſe him, in holineſſe and newnes of life.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we may obſerue the profit of afflictions, when as <note place="margin">The profit of afflictions.</note> they are ſanctified vnto vs by Gods Spirit; for whereas pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie maketh vs blind through pride, ſelfe-loue, and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, ſo as we can neither ſee our ſinnes, nor Gods approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching iudgements; aduerſitie openeth our eyes, and rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the iudgement, ſo as then we not only ſee our ſins, but are readie alſo to condemne our ſelues, iuſtly to haue deſerued thoſe euils, which we ſuffer, yea and far greater, if the Lord ſhould enter into iudgement with vs: for when as the light of nature, our owne conſcience, and the written Word of God teach and conuict vs of this, that God is the chiefe goodnes, moſt gratious, moſt mercifull, and in his owne nature not apt and readie, to hurt and puniſh any of his creatures, but rather to extend his bountie, &amp; multiply his benefits vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, when we fall into miſeries and calamities, we muſt needs iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie God in his iudgements, and condemne our ſelues, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>The firſt is expreſſed in theſe words: <hi>And ſhe did not know that I gaue her corne,</hi> &amp;c.

For though the Heathen na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould not haue knowne or acknowledged the Lord to haue been the giuer of the benefits which they enioyed, it had been no ſuch great wonder, ſeeing they had onely the light of nature, and the booke of the creatures to looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but that the people of Iſrael ſhould be ignorant hereof, was more then blockiſh ſenſeleſneſſe and blind ingratitude, ſeeing they had the booke of God wherein it was reuealed vnto them, that they had all the benefits which they enioyed from the meere bleſſing of God, that the Lord gaue them this land flowing with milke and honey by his owne omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent power, caſting out their enemies before them; that from him they had the firſt and latter raine, whereby their land was made fruitfull; and ſeeing that they were entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to poſſeſſion of al theſe benefits whileſt they ſerued the Lord alone, before they worſhipped their Idols, ſo that they had no ſhew of reaſon to aſcribe Gods gifts vnto them, which they alreadie enioyed before they ſerued them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord might iuſtly take vp that complaint againſt them: Eſa. 1. 2. 3.</p>

               <p>In this place, as I take it, wee are to vnderſtand it in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſignification, for all their pettie patrones and Idoll gods; becauſe we reade that <hi>Baal</hi> the Idoll, ſo ſpecially cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and his Temple were deſtroyed by <hi>Iehu,</hi> neither doe we <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 10. 27.</note> finde that any after him did reſtore him, or reedifie thoſe ruines.</p>
               <p>The ſenſe therfore of theſe words is this, that the Iſraelites beſtowed that wealth which they had receiued from God, vpon their Idols and Images, making them of their gold and ſiluer, as it is Hoſ. 8. 4. or elſe by decking and adorning them <note place="margin">

Whereby the ſinne of this people is much aggraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in that they did not only not glorifie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord in his owne gifts, by giuing vnto him the firſt fruites, and offering vnto him oblations and ſacrifices, which hee required in his law; but alſo ſpent theſe his gifts to the diſhonour of God, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing them vpon their Idols, Gods arch-enemies. Like vnto adulterous harlots, who ſpend the goods which they haue receiued of their husbands in the maintenance of their louers, &amp;c. The like place vnto this wee haue, Ezech. 16. 17. <note place="margin">

               <p>And ſo much for the meaning of the words. The doctrines which we are hence to obſerue are theſe. Firſt, we learne that <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The Do∣ctrines. </seg>
                  </label> the Lord eſteemeth ingratitude as a grieuous ſinne, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth <note place="margin">That igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſinne.</note> it with ſharpe afflictions euen in his owne Church and people. The which ſinne is committed when either through ignorance we know not, or through wilfulneſſe will not acknowledge; or both knowing and acknowledging, yet through negligence doe not returne thankes and praiſe
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:10737:113"/> vnto the Lord for all his benefits: and ſecondly, when as in whole or in part, wee attribute the praiſe of the gifts which we haue receiued from the Lord, vnto any other, as authors and principall cauſes thereof. And thus do men offend when as they aſcribe extraordinarie and vnexpected bleſſings to chance and fortune, and not to Gods prouidence; when as they aſcribe their wealth to their owne wit, labour, or friends, and do not know and acknowledge the Lord to be the chief author and beſtower of the riches which they enioy, or elſe doe not returne thanks and praiſe vnto him for his benefits; when as they aſcribe their health in the firſt place to their good diet, or to the Phyſition, and not to the Lord who is the chiefe preſeruer and reſtorer thereof. But moſt grieuouſly in this reſpect doe they offend, who rob the Lord of thoſe thankes and that praiſe, which is due vnto him for his ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall benefits. For the greater the gifts are, the greater praiſe and thankes is due to the beſtower, and conſequently the greater iniurie and ingratitude when hee is robbed of his right. And thus doe thoſe offend who aſcribe the praiſe of theſe benefits vnto the interceſſion of Saints, and ſo robbe Chriſt of his glorie, who alone by his interceſſion obtaineth them for vs at his fathers hands: thus doe they offend, who aſcribe their iuſtification and ſaluation either in whole or in part, to their workes and worthineſſe, or vnto the merits of Saints, which is to be attributed onely to Gods free mercie and Chriſts al-ſufficient merits: thus doe they offend who doe not know, or acknowledge, that it is the blood of Chriſt alone which waſheth away all our ſinnes, but think that they haue remiſſion, by Maſſes, popiſh pardons, penance, pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, oblations, Saints relikes, holiwater and ſuch like. All which and all other of the like kinde are eſteemed as idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous vnthankfulneſſe in Gods ſight.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we here learne, that ignorance doth not excuſe <note place="margin">Ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce doth not excuſe ſin, nor exempt vs from puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> our ſinnes, nor exempt vs from Gods iudgements, nay ſo far is it from excuſing other ſins, and from exempting vs from puniſhment, that it ſelfe is a ſin and deſerueth puniſhment, as appeareth in this place. Which notwithſtanding, is not to
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:10737:113"/> be vnderſtood, of that ignorance which is naturall and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie, for want of the meanes of knowledge, for though this be not only the puniſhment of ſin, but alſo a branch of our originall corruption, yet doth it extenuate our ſins, and mitigate our puniſhments, as appeareth, Luk. 12. 48. Act. 3. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 48. <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 17. 17. 30. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 13.</note> 17. 17. 30. 1. Tim. 1. 13. but of that ignorance, which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through negligence, or obſtinately affected, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding God granteth vnto vs plentifull meanes of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; which is ſo far from excuſing other ſins, that it ſelfe is eſteemed by the Lord a grieuous ſin, and is ſeuerely puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as being not onely a haynous ſinne in it ſelfe, but alſo the chiefe roote of all other ſinnes, either of omiſſion, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we may here learne, that as ingratitude is a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous <note place="margin">Ingratitude is moſt hainous in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church.</note> ſinne in all; ſo eſpecially in thoſe who are members of the Church, as it is emphatically ſignified in theſe words: <hi>And ſhe knew not,</hi> &amp;c. For they not onely receiue from God the greateſt benefits, and therefore ſhould returne vnto him the greateſt thankfulnes, but alſo are ſufficiently inſtructed, both by the word of God, and by their continuall experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that they haue all theſe benefits from the Lord, and that of his meere mercie and grace, and therefore it is more then brutiſh ignorance, and impious ingratitude, either not to know and acknowledge the Lord to be the ſole author of all theſe benefits, or not to returne vnto him continuall thankes and praiſe for them. The which ſin is too too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in our times, euen in the cleare light of the Goſpell, both in reſpect of all other benefits which we enioy, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in reſpect of our daily food, which men (as not knowing, or not acknowledging God to be the giuer of it) do vſually receiue, without praiſing God or giuing thankes, in which reſpect they are farre worſe then the oxe or aſſe, as <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſay</hi> 1. 3. Not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Lord the ſole author of his gifts, is not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him at all.</note> the Prophet ſpeaketh, Eſay 1. 3.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we here obſerue, that not to acknowledge the Lord to be the ſole author of his gifts, nor to yeeld vnto him the whole praiſe of them, is not to know, or acknowledge him at all, as appeareth in this place; for though the Iſraelites
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:10737:114"/> did in part, aſcribe their benefits receiued vnto God, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not acknowledge him the ſole author of them, but ioyned with him copartners in his praiſe, becauſe they did not acknowledge, that they had receiued them of his meere mercie, but for their new worſhip which they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto him in their idols, therfore the Lord condemneth them of ignorant ingratitude, as though hee were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged at all. The reaſon is, becauſe the Lord cannot indure any ſharing or halting in his ſeruice, he cannot abide to haue any partners of his praiſes, which are due to himſelf, and therefore hee will haue all or none: for well the Lord knoweth, that they who ſerue &amp; praiſe him to the halues, wil in the end neither ſerue, nor praiſe him at all. Wherby it may appeare, that the ſeruice of the Church of Rome, which they performe vnto God, is no better then abominable idolatrie, and their praiſes odious in his ſight, as ſauouring of groſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude; for though they ſerue God indeed, yet not in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and truth, but in their Idols; though they acknowledge, and praiſe God as the author of his gifts, yet not him alone, for they ioyne with him the virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> and innumerable Saints, many whereof are of their owne making, as pettie gods and patrones, vnto whom they yeeld a chiefe part of their thankes and praiſe; though they acknowledge God to haue giuen vnto them the benefits which they enioy, yet not of his meere mercie and grace, but for their owne merits, and through the interceſſion of Saints. But the Lord eſteemeth theſe halfe praiſes to be diſhonors, and this partie and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thankfulnes, to bee no better then groſſe ingratitude, 2. King. 17. 32. 33. 41. <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 17. 32. 33. The exceſſiue coſt which idolaters do beſtow vpon their idols.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, we may obſerue, what exceſſiue coſt idolaters are readie to beſtow vpon their idols and images: for though they highly eſteeme their gold, ſiluer, and iewels, yet doe they willingly beſtow them vpon <hi>Baal,</hi> that is, for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and adorning of their idols, and for the furthering of their ſuperſtitions; though they will hardly part with the leaſt trifle in obedience to Gods Commandement, to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of his glorie, and furthering of his pure worſhip
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:10737:114"/> and ſeruice, yet they thinke their whole ſubſtance little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be beſtowed vpon their owne wil-worſhip, &amp; for the maintenance of their idolatrie. An example whereof we haue in this place, and in the Iſraelites, Exod. 32. 3. Ezech. 16. 16. to 21. And in the Papiſts, who care not what they <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 3. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16. 16. 21.</note> beſtow vpon the making and adorning of their images, in maintaining their Clergie, the Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> in building Monaſteries and Nunneries, in Copes, veſtiments, oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in procuring pardons, and ſuch like their ſuperſtitions. The which their bountie in their wil-worſhip and idolatrie, ſhould make vs aſhamed of our baſe niggardlineſſe, in fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering, ſetting forth, and maintaining Gods pure worſhip and ſeruice, which is enioyned in his word: for what a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach is this to our Chriſtian profeſſion, that they ſhould ſo much exceed in their blind zeale and forwardnes vnto ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, and wee bee ſo cold in Gods true religion: that they ſhould beſtow ſuch exceſſiue coſt in building Churches, in honor of their Saints, and we be ſo backward in repairing of God houſe: that they ſhould ſo liberally maintaine ſuch ſwarmes of locuſts, and innumerable numbers of the Prieſts of <hi>Baal,</hi> and we ſuffer Gods true Prophets, which in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon are but few in number, to liue in want, that idolaters ſhould endow the Church with goods and lands; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Gods true religion, ſhould rob and ſpoile it of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie maintenance? Surely their fruitfull ignorance ſhall condemne our barren knowledge; their ſuperſtitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, our coldneſſe and ſlackeneſſe; their liberalitie in euil, our niggardlines in that which is good; and their great loue vnto their idols and idolatrie, ſhall riſe in iudgement againſt our little loue to God and his truth.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we may obſerue, that it is a grieuous ſinne to abuſe <note place="margin">That it is a great ſinne to abuſe Gods gifts to his diſhonor.</note> the gifts which wee haue receiued from God, to other or contrarie ends, then thoſe for which the Lord hath giuen them; for this is heere condemned in the Iſraelites, in that they beſtowed their gold and ſiluer vpon their idols, which they ſhould haue imployed to the glorie of God, and good of his Church. Thus the Papiſts offend, who beſtow their
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:10737:115"/> wealth vpon their Images, Copes, Monaſteries. Thus carnall Goſpellers offend, who ſpend their riches vpon gorgeous attire vnfitting their calling, vpon exceſſiue cheere and vaine pleaſures, which they haue receiued from God, to this end, that out of their ſuperfluitie, they ſhould releeue the penury of their poore brethren. Thus do they offend, who vſe their tongue to the blaſpheming of Gods name, which is giuen them to glorifie him. And thus doe they offend, who abuſe their wits and learning, for the nouriſhing of contentions, and the maintenance and vpholding of iniurie, oppreſſion, and iniuſtice, which were giuen them to make peace, right wrongs, and further iuſtice, as it is the vſuall fault of the Lawyers of our times, &amp;c. All which, being not only vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſeruants, in not vſing the Lords talents, but alſo wicked and malicious enemies, who abuſe them to his diſhonour, ſhall if they perſeuere in this ſinne without repentance, haue their portion in the lake which burneth with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>I will returne and take away,</hi> &amp;c. Some reſolue theſe words thus: <hi>I will receiue,</hi> or <hi>reſume my corne:</hi> becauſe the former verbe in the Hebrew phraſe, hath in it ſometimes the nature of an aduerbe. So Geneſ. 26. 18. <hi>Iſaak returning, digged the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>welles of water, which they had digged in the daies of Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. that is, he redigged them. But as I take it, the word in this place hath a greater emphaſis in it, and ſignifieth thus much; that howſoeuer the Lord ſeemed by his long defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of puniſhment, and by the continuance of his mercie in ſuffering them ſtill to enioy his gifts, either to approue, or at leaſt not to regard their wickednes, and groſſe abuſe of his benefits, yet now he would take a new courſe with them, ſo as they ſhould ſee that he was a iuſt God, who would not let ſin for euer go vnpuniſhed. In former times the Lord had multiplied his gifts vpon them, as their corne, wine, oyle, &amp;c. and that oftentimes beyond all hope and expectation, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of naturall cauſes, that ſo they might not reſt vpon the ſtarres and planets, nor feare the ſignes, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Gentiles, but relie vpon his al-ſufficient proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as himſelfe commandeth them, Ier. 10. 2. And hauing <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jerem.</hi> 10. 2.</note> his bleſſings powred vpon them, as it were with his owne immediate hand, they might learne hereby to acknowledge and praiſe him, as the author of theſe his gifts. But when not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this they would not learne hereby to praiſe the Lord, as being the cauſe of all their benefits, but aſcribed
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:10737:116"/> them to their Idols, the Lord threatneth that hee would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne and alter his former courſe, by depriuing them of all his bleſſings, euen when in reſpect of inferiour cauſes and meanes they ſeemed moſt aſſured of them; that ſo if his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarie manner of beſtowing them would not, yet his extraordinarie taking them away, might moue them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that he alone was the beſtower of them.</p>
               <p>Now the things of which the Lord threatneth to depriue them of, are their corne and wine, their wooll and flaxe, all which before they had aſcribed to their Idols, and abuſed to their ſeruice; vnder which particulars here as before, wee are to vnderſtand not only all things appertaining to their food and apparell, but all other commodities belonging to this life: So 1. Tim. 6. 8. <hi>When we haue food and raiment, let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And further, wee are to note that the Lord calleth theſe things his, <hi>my corne and my wine,</hi> &amp;c. whereby hee meeteth with the erroneous conceit of the Iſraelites, who imagined that theſe bleſſings of God were giuen vnto them by their Idols, as a reward of their ſeruice; and therefore that they were ſo become their owne, that they might vſe or rather abuſe them at their pleaſure, verſ. 5. But the Lord telleth them, that they were not their Idols gifts, but his bleſſings; which becauſe they did not hold of him, as of the grand Lord and owner of them, therefore hee would (as hee iuſtly might) take away from them theſe things which were his owne, vnto which they had no right; that ſo they might learne to giue vnto him the praiſe of his owne gifts.</p>
               <p>The time alſo when the Lord threatneth to reſume his gifts is expreſſed; <hi>I will take away my corne in the time thereof,</hi> that is, in the time of their harueſt, <hi>and my wine in the ſeaſon thereof,</hi> that is, in the vintage; as though he ſhould ſay, When moſt eſpecially they expect theſe benefits, I will fruſtrate their hope, and ſo make their affliction more intolerable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſhall come vnlooked for, and in ſuch a time wherein they made ſure account of plentie. And I will bring ſuch a ſcarcitie amongſt them of theſe bleſſings, that there ſhal be a
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:10737:116"/> want of them euen in the time of harueſt and vintage, when they vſually moſt abound: and therefore if they wanted in the time of their greateſt plentie, how great was their penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie like to be, when that ſmall ſtore they had was ſpent and conſumed? The which dearth was cauſed, either by the curſe of God vpon their land, ſo as it could not yeeld her increaſe, which is threatned, Leuit. 26. 20. or through the abundance <note place="margin">

                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. 9.</note> that God had taken away <hi>Labans</hi> ſubſtance, and giuen them vnto him, becauſe it was wrongfully poſſeſſed by <hi>Laban,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it belonged vnto <hi>Iacob,</hi> as a reward of his painfull ſeruice. So the Iſraelites are commanded to take away the Egyptians goods and to ſpoyle them, becauſe they wrongfully with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held them in their hands from the Iſraelites, ſeeing they were due to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their great paines and tedious bondage, Exod. 3. 22.

                  <hi>wooll and my flaxe,</hi> &amp;c. which commeth all to the ſame end: for when the creatures of God are vniuſtly poſſeſſed and abuſed to other ends, then thoſe for which God hath giuen them, they may bee ſaid to bee in a kinde of bondage, from which they are freed when God plucketh them from ſuch <note place="margin">

               <p>The meaning therefore of theſe words is, that the Lord would plucke out of the hands of the idolatrous Iſraelites theſe his bleſſings, becauſe they vniuſtly poſſeſſed them and abuſed them to wicked purpoſes. They poſſeſſed them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſtly, becauſe they did not acknowledge them, as held of the Lord the true owner of heauen and earth: for as he hath

                  <hi>Lent to couer her ſhame.</hi> The word here vſed ſignifieth, <hi>her nakedneſſe,</hi> and more eſpecially the nakedneſſe of the ſecret parts. Whereby ſome vnderſtand that theſe idolaters abuſed the gifts of God to couer their ſpirituall nakedneſſe, and did hide their ſinnes vnder the vaile of Gods benefits. But, as I take it, the more ſimple and plaine interpretation is beſt, and moſt agreeable to the text, namely, that the Lord would take away from her, his wooll and flaxe, becauſe whereas hee had giuen vnto them theſe things, that they might with them apparell themſelues and hide their nakedneſſe, they abuſed them for the decking and adorning of their Idols. As it may plainly appeare, if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pare this verſe with the former, and with Ezech. 16. 16. 17. 18. So that theſe words are added, to ſhew the lawfull vſe of theſe benefits, for which God gaue <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16. 16. 17.</note> them, that their groſſe abuſe of them might the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of theſe words. Out of which we <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The Do∣ctrines. </seg>
                  </label> may obſerue, firſt, that howſoeuer the Lord in his patience and long-ſuffering, doth deferre our iuſtly deſerued puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <note place="margin">Impenitencie moueth the Lord to turne mercie into iudgement.</note> and in ſtead of them giues vnto vs the fruition of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold benefits; yet if this his mercie will not mooue vs to feare him, and to repent of our ſinnes, he will not for euer ſpare vs, but he will returne and alter his courſe, ſtripping vs of all his benefits, and turning mercie into iudgement. An example whereof wee haue in the Iſraelites in this place; in the time of our Sauiour Chriſt: as alſo in the primitiue Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Rome, Corinth, Galatin,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we learne that our vnthankfulneſſe in not aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing <note place="margin">Our vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes moueth the Lord to ſtrip vs of his gifts.</note> of Gods benefits vnto him, or in aſcribing them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:10737:117"/> cauſes beſides him, or ioyntly with him doth moue the Lord to take his gifts away from vs, that ſo if wee cannot know and acknowledge him the Lord and owner of them when they abound, we may learne this dutie by the want of them. For ſuch is our corruption and ignorant vnthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that wee are more readie to acknowledge the Lord the author of all the good things which we enioy, when hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them away, then when he beſtoweth them; he is better knowne and acknowledged to be the feeder of his creatures in the time of dearth, then in the time of plentie; to bee the author of health in the time of ſicknes, then when wee are whole and ſound; to be the giuer of riches in the time of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, then in abundance; to be our preſeruer rather in the middeſt of dangers, then when wee are moſt ſecure. So that Gods gifts make vs forget the giuer, and with forgetfulneſſe is ioyned his vſuall companion vnthankfulneſſe. And this is one ſpeciall cauſe why the Lord taketh them from vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his iudgements doe better teach vs then his mercies. And therfore if we would not be ſtripped of Gods benefits, let vs learne to acknowledge him the fountain of them, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt we enioy them, and yeeld vnto him the whole praiſe of his owne gifts. And to this end let vs remember the example of <hi>Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar, Herod,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we here learne that the Lord is the true and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <note place="margin">The Lord is the abſolute owner of all the good things which we enioy. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24. 1.</note> owner of all the benefits which wee poſſeſſe; for ſo hee calleth them here, <hi>my corne, my wine,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that we are not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Lords of thoſe things which we vſually call our own, but only the Lords bailiefs and ſtewards, and therefore ſhall one day be called to a reckoning, how we haue vſed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed them. The conſideration whereof ſhould moue vs, to vſe the Lords goods to the glorie of the owner and the good of our fellow ſeruants, as he hath commanded vs; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt we imagine that we haue abſolute authoritie ouer the things we poſſeſſe to doe with them what we liſt, ſeeing the Lord hath chiefe intereſt in them. And if this were well thought of, men would not be ſo cloſe handed to their poore brethren: for what ſteward can anſwere it to his Lord, if he
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:10737:118"/> ſuffer his fellow-ſeruant to pine for want, withholding from him his portion which his maſter hath allotted him? neither would they be ſo open handed, to miſpend Gods gifts to his diſhonour, by gaming, gluttonie and exceſſe, brauerie in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell and ſuch like abuſes. For this will be but a bad recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in the day of our generall accounts, when we ſhall ſay, ſo much laid out on vnlawfull pleaſures, ſo much ſpent in gorgeous attire, ſo much conſumed in law, to haue my will vpon my neighbour, &amp;c. For this will be thought far worſe, then with the vnprofitable ſeruant, to haue hid our talent in a napkin, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we learne, that there is no certaintie, nor ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <note place="margin">That there is no certaintie in the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarie benefits.</note> cauſe of ſecuritie, in theſe worldly and temporarie bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits; ſeeing God oftentimes depriues vs of them, when wee thinke our ſelues moſt aſſured to enioy them. Innumerable be the vnlooked for accidents, which may ſpoile the fruits of the earth, both in ſeed time, winter, ſpring and ſummer, as too much raine, too much drought, wormes, cankers, cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillers, blaſtings, mildewes and ſuch like. But though they eſcape all theſe, yet can they promiſe vnto vs no certaintie of enioying them: ſeeing the Lord for our ſinnes can take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our corne in the time of harueſt, and our wine in the vintage, either by vnſeaſonable weather, or the inuaſion of our enemies. He can ſincke the ſhip in the hauen, as well as in the middeſt of the ocean: and he can pluck back his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits from vs, euen when we are readie to ſtretch out the hand to receiue them. The conſideration wherof, ſhould make vs neuer to promiſe vnto our ſelues ſecuritie and certaintie of theſe benefits, ſo long as liuing in our ſinnes without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, we iuſtly prouoke the Lord to ſtrip vs of them. And ſecondly, we may hereby be moued, not to put our truſt and confidence in theſe worldly things, for our preſeruation, ſeeing they are moſt vncertaine; but to place our whole affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the Lord, who will neuer faile them in time of need, who reſt and relie themſelues vpon his prouidence.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, we may heere obſerue, that all thoſe, who doe not <note place="margin">Thoſe are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpers of</note> hold the benefits which they enioy, as from the Lord, but
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:10737:118"/> aſcribe them to their friends, their owne wit, labour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrie, <note place="margin">Gods gifts, who do not acknowledge that they hold them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him.</note> they are vniuſtly poſſeſſed of them, becauſe they hold them by an vnlawfull tenure, and therefore may at the will of the grand-Lord of heauen and earth, be iuſtly euery minute diſpoſſeſſed of them. And though he ſuffer them for a time to hold them in their cuſtodie, yet they are not to be eſteemed true owners, but vſurpers and intruders into that which belongeth not vnto them; and therefore in the great day of aſſiſes they ſhall anſwere for it, &amp;c.</p>

So that ſtill he alludeth to the practiſe of inſolent and impudent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultereſſes, who when their husbands threaten, that for their whoredomes, they will ſtrip them of all the gifts which they haue beſtowed on them, they are readie to deterre them from ſuch ſeuere courſes, by telling them that they haue friends in ſtore, who wil reuenge their wrongs, and not ſuffer them to be ſo euill intreated; vnto whom their husbands being men of ſpirit and courage, will returne anſwere, that they are ſo farre from fearing their louers, that they will not ſticke thus to vſe them euen in their preſence.</p>
               <p>But let vs come to the words themſelues: in which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, firſt the time, when he would inflict his puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: <hi>And now will I,</hi> &amp;c. where he ſheweth, that becauſe his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and long-ſuffering had made her inſolent and ſecure,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:10737:119"/> he would no longer make delayes, but preſently execute his iudgements vpon her: and this hee doth to make her rouſe vp her ſpirits, and ſpeedily to turne vnto him by true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Eccleſ. 8. 11. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 8. 11.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, hee ſetteth downe the puniſhment it ſelfe, to wit, that he would diſcouer her leaudneſſe, &amp;c. The word here vſed ſignifieth, either fooliſhnes, or filthines: in the firſt ſenſe it is taken, 1. Sam. 25. 25. Pſal. 14. 1. Deut. 32. 6. in the latter, Gen. 34. 7. Deut. 22. 21. If we vnderſtand it in the former ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 1. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 6. <hi>Gen.</hi> 34. 7. <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 21.</note> the meaning is, that by ſtripping her of all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, he would ſhew, that ſhe had done fooliſhly, in aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing them to her louers, ſeeing they were his gifts; and in forſaking him, a God moſt gratious and almightie, that ſhe might follow after her louers, who had neither will nor abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to releeue her wants. But the coherence with the former words is better, if we vnderſtand it in the latter ſignification, for in the former verſe, the Lord threatneth, that he would ſtrip her of his benefits, and namely, of her clothes, which he had giuen her to couer her nakednes: and here hee ſheweth that he would not ſtrip her in a corner, but euen in the ſight of her louers, that they might alſo behold, and deteſt her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable filthineſſe. And this interpretation I rather em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, then the other, becauſe it agreeth with the like places of Scripture, as Ezech. 16. 37. Ier. 4. 30. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16. 37. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4 30.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now this her puniſhment is aggrauated, in that he ſaith, he would ſtrip her in the ſight of her louers; for as men are impatient of all diſgraces, ſo eſpecially of thoſe, which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered them in the preſence of their moſt reſpected friends: but they grow altogether intolerable, when as their friends in whom they moſt truſted, ſhall to their ſhame and reproch ſee their wretchednes, and vncleane filthines, and not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make any apologie for them, or to defend them againſt the accuſer. But this the Lord threatneth, ſhould be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church of Iſrael, namely, that hee would ſtrip her of all his benefits, and diſcouer her naturall filthines and vncleannes, her pouertie, miſerie, ſinne and groſſe corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and that in the ſight of her louers; that is, when ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:10737:119"/> vpon her idols, and moſt aſſuredly hoped, that they were preſent to helpe and releeue her.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, becauſe while they conceiued any hope of helpe in their idols, they would eaſily neglect and contemne Gods threatnings, hee taketh away from them this vaine confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in theſe words: <hi>And no man ſhall be able te deliuer her out of my hands:</hi> as though he ſhould ſay, It may be ſhe will hope, when I haue taken from her my benefits, that the ſun, ſtarres, planets, and her other idols will ſupplie her wants; it may be ſhe may thinke, that when I haue diſcouered her fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thines, her louers wil relieue her miſeries: but all in vaine; for who amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the gods is able to help, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I who am almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie take in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to puniſh her? Wel may they behold her abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable filthines, to her further griefe and diſgrace; but they ſhal only look vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, &amp; not be able to afford her any relief.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of theſe words. Out of which we <note place="margin">Puniſhments deferred, ſhall be inflicted, vnleſſe wee preuent them by repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance.</note> may firſt learne, that howſoeuer the Lord in his mercie, doth long deferre our iuſtly deſerued puniſhments, as he did the Iſraelites, of whom the Prophet ſpeaketh here: yet if his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and long-ſuffering doe not moue vs to repentance, the time will come that the Lord will ſay, as he doth in this place; And now I will diſcouer your leaudneſſe, &amp;c. For as there is a time for mercie, ſo there is a time for iuſtice, and though the Lord be ſlow to anger and vengeance, and ſwift in the courſe of his grace and goodnes, yet he goeth forward as ſurely and certainly in the way of iuſtice, as in the way of mercie, if wee doe not meet him in the way, and turne his courſe by turning vnto him by vnfained repentance. Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples hereof we haue in the old world, in the Sodomites, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanites, Iſraelites, &amp;c. And therefore let vs <hi>ſeeke the Lord whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest he may be found,</hi> &amp;c. Iſay 55. 6. let vs take hold of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable <note place="margin">

For though the Lord now hide our ſinnes vnder the vaile of his mercie, bleſſings and benefits, yet the time <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. 7. 8.</note> will come, vnleſſe we repent, when as hee will ſtrip vs, and diſcouer our filthines, &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:10737:120"/>
               <p> Secondly, we may obſerue, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the Lord oftentimes puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our vaine confidence in worldly things, by making them <note place="margin">God puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to helpe.</note> vneffectuall, and inſufficient to ſatisfie our deſires, in thoſe things for which we moſt truſted in them, &amp; that when they moſt abound, and ſeeme to promiſe vs moſt aſſured helpe. So heere hee ſtrippeth the Iſraelites in the preſence of their idols, in whom they truſted for deliuerance, and diſcouereth their filthines euen in their ſight, when as they ſeemed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their preſence, to giue them the greateſt hope of their aſſiſtance. Thus he ouerthrew <hi>Pharaoh, Senacherib, Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadad,</hi> in the middeſt of their great armies; <hi>Nebuchadnezer</hi> in his greateſt pride and power. Thus he deſtroyeth idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the preſence of their idols: thus he maketh the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to feel the ſmart of his puniſhing hand, when as their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches wherin they truſted, cannot yeeld vnto them any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we may obſerue, that howſoeuer our ſins in mans <note place="margin">Sinne maketh vs vgly in Gods ſight.</note> carnall iudgement, do exceedingly grace and adorne vs, as beautifull ornaments; yet in truth they defile both our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and ſoules, and make them filthie and vgly in Gods ſight, yea and in our owne too, when as we come to a true view and ſenſible feeling of them. As for example, ruffinlie oathes, ſcurrilous ieſts, which are but the ſcumme and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of the wit, pride, gorgeous attire vnfitting our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, painting the face, and diſcouering the breaſts, luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous niceneſſe and exceſſe in diet, furious thirſting after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge vpon the leaſt ſhew of a diſgrace offered, and ſuch like ſinnes, which are vſed of worldlings, as ornaments to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them, but in Gods ſight, they make them to appeare deformed, filthie and abominable.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we may obſerue, how prone we are to truſt in <note place="margin">Our prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to truſt in worldly meanes.</note> worldly meanes, and in regard of our vaine confidence, how apt we are to ſhrowde our ſelues vnder theſe vaine ſhields, imaging that by them we ſhall be ſecured from Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments threatned againſt vs: ſo the Iſraelites here truſted for deliuerance from all euils which were denounced againſt them, by the helpe of their Idols. And therefore the Lord to
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:10737:120"/> beate them from this vaine confidence, telleth them, that he will inflict his iudgements vpon them, though their louers looked on, neither ſhould they be able to deliuer them out of his hands. Thus the Iſraelites truſted to the outward pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the viſible Arke, 1. Sam. 4. 3. 4. to the helpe of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 3. 4. <hi>Eſay</hi> 31. 1. 3. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10. 13. <hi>Ierem.</hi> 49. 16.</note> Eſai. 31. 1. 3. to the viſible Temple, Ier. 7. 5. to their multitude of ſtrong men, Hoſ. 10. 13. Thus the Idomeans truſted to the ſtrength of their ſeat, Ier. 49. 16. And thus in our times, men in dearth truſt to their owne prouiſion, in warre to their ſtrength, in ſickneſſe to their flight, preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and medicines; and when the thundering threatnings of Gods iudgements ſound in their eares, they hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from them vnder the ſhadow of thoſe outward titles, the Goſpell, the Church, and profeſſion of Gods true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But the Lord will inflict his iudgements, euen in the ſight of our louers, and thoſe things wherein wee truſted, ſhall not be able to deliuer vs in the day of his viſitation.</p>

               <p>And ſo much for the meaning of the words.

For whereas he ſaith that he would deſtroy her vines, and figge trees; vnder theſe ſpecials he doth by a Synecdoche generally vnderſtand, that hee would vtterly ſpoile their pleaſant gardens, and fruitful orchards and vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, yea and all their fertile countrie, with all the encreaſe thereof. So that heere hee denounceth a farre more heauie iudgement, then that contained in the ninth verſe, namely, that hee would take away their corne and wine, that is, the fruites of the earth: for though there had been a dearth of them through one yeeres ſcarcitie, yet their gardens, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, fields and vineyards remaining vntouched of Gods puniſhing hand, the fruitfulnes of the following yeere might haue ſupplied the want and defect of his foreruiner: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they alſo were waſted and deſtroied, there remained no hope of any reliefe. And this he threatneth, becauſe as they aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the fruites of the earth to their Idols, ſo alſo euen their fields, orchards, trees, and vines themſelues according to the cuſtome of the Heathen. The which their ſinne was the more vnexcuſable, becauſe the Lord had taught them, not only by continuall experience, but alſo by his written word, that all theſe were his bleſſings and benefits, and therefore the praiſe of them was due vnto him alone: Deut. 8. 7. 8. <note place="margin">

The word here vſed ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the hire which the harlot receiueth, for proſtituting her ſelfe to the adulterer, whereby is ſignified, that they had, after the manner of impudent harlots, committed ſpirituall adulterie with their Idols, and afterwards boaſted that they had receiued all theſe benefits of their falſe gods, for that idolatrous worſhip which they had performed vnto them.</p>
               <p>And therefore becauſe they robbed God of that glorie and thankfulneſſe, which was due vnto him for his own gifts, the Lord threatneth to take them away, that ſo by their want of them, they might learne to acknowledge the Lord to bee the author of them.</p>
               <p>Moreouer he ſaith, that he would make them, namely their vines and figge trees, their orchards, gardens and vineyards, waſte and deſert, like vnto a forreſt which is barren &amp; fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe: in which words he threatneth, that ſuch ſhould be the deſolation of the land, that their fruitfull orchards and vineyards ſhould bee turned into a vaſt and deſert wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>And laſtly he ſaith, that the wilde beaſts ſhould eate them: the which words may bee vnderſtood either literally thus, that their countrie ſhould by their enemies be ſo diſpeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, and al husbandry intermitted, that wilde beaſts ſhould make their dennes, and feed in their vineyards and orchards; or allegorically, that their enemies the Aſſyrians, ſhould like wilde beaſts make ſpoyle and hauocke of all, not only eating their fruites, but alſo deſtroying their orchards and vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards. Whereby their vtter ſubuerſion and deſolation is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied: for when the enemie ſpareth the trees and gardens, he doth not intend the deſtruction of a countrie, but the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging of his owne Empire and dominions, as wee may ſee Eſa. 36. 16. but when he deſtroyeth theſe, and maketh hauock <note place="margin">

               <p>And this is the meaning of thoſe words. Out of which we

                  </label> another, and cauſeth his Prophet to denounce great varietie of iudgements, that ſo hee might fit himſelfe to euery ones <note place="margin">That God fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſion of al the elect.</note> diſpoſition, and draw all vnto God by true repentance. One is touched with the lighter chaſtiſements, others not moued vnleſſe they heare of more heauie iudgements; one is affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with one kind of puniſhment, another with ſuch an one as is of a diuers qualitie; ſome with pouertie, ſome with ſhame, ſome with ſpirituall, ſome with corporall afflictions: and ſome are not moued at all vnleſſe they heare of vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation and deſtruction; and therefore according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie of mens mindes the Lord varieth his threatnings, as appeareth in this place. Whereby we may learne, how impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent and hard hearted wee are, ſeeing the Lord is faine to vſe ſo many meanes, and to trie (as it were) ſo many conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for our conuerſion: and alſo wee may heere obſerue Gods infinite goodneſſe and mercie, which hee ſheweth not only in his promiſes, but alſo in his threatnings. For whereas he might iuſtly when we ſinne vtterly deſtroy vs, he giueth vs warning by his threatnings, that being moued thereby to repent, wee may eſcape his puniſhments; yea and that not ſome few times, for he threatneth often, but ſeldome puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth, he denounceth many kindes of iudgements before he inflicteth any one of them: whereby it manifeſtly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that in his threatnings he aimeth at our conuerſion, and not at our ſubuerſion and deſtruction; and that he is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to puniſh in his owne nature, vnleſſe we force him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by our ſtubborne impenitencie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee here learne, not to truſt in the fruitfulneſſe <note place="margin">We muſt not truſt in the fruitfulneſſe of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie for our ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenance.</note> of our countrie for our prouiſion and ſuſtenance, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding wee continually prouoke the Lord vnto anger by our ſinnes; for though it abound with vines and figge trees, with corne and wine, with pleaſant orchards and fruitfull fields, yet the Lord can eaſily finde meanes, either by laying his curſe vpon the land, or by giuing vs ouer to the ſpoyle of our enemies, to make the moſt fruitfull places a deſert wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe. And therefore let vs ſo liue as his children and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:10737:123"/> performing obedience vnto his will, and then we may reſt boldly and ſecurely vpon his neuer failing prouidence: otherwiſe our beſt meanes will not preſerue vs, when with our ſins and wickednes we prouoke his anger, and moue him in his iuſt diſpleaſure to ſtrip vs of all his benefits; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in this place, in the example of Sodom and Gomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah: ſo Ioel. 2. 3.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, we may obſerue, that howſoeuer theſe idolaters <note place="margin">Idolaters vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally pleade their merits.</note> do aſcribe vnto their idols, all the benefits which they enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet not as their free and vndeſerued gifts, but as rewards and hire, which they had beſtowed vpon them for that ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous worſhip &amp; ſeruice, which they had done vnto them; and this is the diſpoſition of all idolaters and ſuperſtitious perſons, to ſhare with their idols, in the praiſe of the benefits which they enioy, imagining indeed, that they haue beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them vpon them, but for their deſerts and merits. And as the Heathen idolaters dealt with their idols, ſo after the ſame manner at this day, deale the Papiſts with God himſelfe, ſharing with him in his glorie, by aſcribing part of the praiſe vnto him, and part vnto their owne workes and merits.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we may heere obſerue, that howſoeuer the Lord <note place="margin">Affliction en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, without repentance.</note> threatneth before he puniſheth, and when he beginneth to correct, proceedeth by degrees, from lighter to heauier pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, that his mercy, goodnes, and long-ſuffering, may appeare in his ſo long ſparing vs; yet iſ neither his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, nor more eaſie corrections will reclaime vs, nor mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie our ſtonie hearts with true contrition, his iudgements will end in our vtter deſtruction and deſolation. When his vineyard is fruitleſſe, firſt he vſeth the pruning knife of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he diggeth and dungeth it, and then expecteth fruit; but if ſtill it be barren and vnprofitable, he taketh away the hedge, and breaketh downe the wall, and layeth it waſte and deſolate: as it is, Eſay 5. 5. 6. If the knife will do no good, to <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſai.</hi> 5. 5. 6.</note> make the tree fruitfull, by pruning the branches, he will lay the axe to the root, and cut it downe, Mat. 3. 10. Luk. 13. 6. 9. <note place="margin">

               <p>The denunciation of their puniſhment is expreſſed in theſe words: <hi>I will viſite.</hi> Where the Lord ſheweth, that he would no longer defere his puniſhments, nor ſeeme to wincke at their ſins: but now he would begin to inflict his iudgements on them, which their wickednes deſerued; yet not raſhly, but aduiſedly, and vpon mature deliberation, as hee noteth by the word <hi>viſite,</hi> of which I haue more largely ſpoken, when I handled the fourth verſe of the firſt chapter.</p>
               <p>Their ſinne is firſt generally ſignified in theſe words, <hi>The daies of Baalim.</hi> By which we are to vnderſtand the daies of their idolatrie, or all the time wherein they had worſhipped idols, ſince the Lord had made his couenant with them, and had maried them vnto himſelfe, which was ſoone after their comming out of Egypt. So that heere he threatneth to viſite vpon them, not only the idolatrie which in their owne time was committed, but the idolatrie of their fore-fathers, of
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:10737:124"/> which we may reade, Exod. 32. 1. &amp; verſ. 34. Numb. 25. 1. 3. <note place="margin">

According to that in the ſecond Commandement, <hi>For I am the Lord thy God, a iealous God, viſiting the iniquitie of the fathers vpon the children</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he ſetteth downe their progreſſe in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular kinds of their idolatrie: firſt, that they burnt incenſe, that is, performed vnto them idolatrous ſeruice, in offering vnto them ſacrifices and oblations: ſecondly, that they were ſo bewitched with that pleaſure and delight, which they tooke in their idolatrie, that they thought no pompe, coſt, decking with precious ornaments, ſufficient to ſet forth their idolatrie, in theſe words, <hi>And ſhee decked her ſelfe with her earings, and her iewels:</hi> where he ſtill alludeth to the manner of harlots; for as they being to come into the companie of their louers, do vſe all their art and skill in ſetting themſelues foorth, by putting on their richeſt ornaments, that by theſe baits, they may more forciblie allure them to commit vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe with them: ſo theſe idolaters, when as they were to celebrate their ſolemne feſtiuals, in the ſeruice of their idols, placed a great part of their ſuperſtitious deuotion, in decking and adorning both themſelues, and their idol gods, that ſo they might take greater pleaſure in their idolatrie; and with theſe pompous ſhewes intice others to ioyne with them, in committing this ſpirituall whoredome. And here we are further to obſerue, that hee calleth them her iewels, and her earings, to note vnto them, that they had not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this whoriſh and idolatrous maner of worſhip from the Lord, but that it was their owne, not enioyned by God, but hammered out in the forge of their owne inuentions, and caſt in the mould of their owne braine.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he ſaith, that ſhe followed her louers: whereby is ſignified their obſtinate perſiſtance in this their ſin; for they did not once or twice fall into this ſin, through errour or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie, but they followed their idols,, and went on in the courſe of their ſuperſtitions, walking in their idolatries, as in
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:10737:125"/> their vſual path, and common high way. So verſ. 6.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he ſaith, that their hearts were ſo wholly ſet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their idols, and that they followed them with ſuch great earneſtnes and intention of minde, that they forgate the Lord; like vnto harlots, who are ſo bewitched, and wholly tranſported with a furie of blind loue, or rather luſt towards their louers, that they altogether forget their lawfull huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and all the benefits which they haue receiued from them. So that heere he aggrauateth the impious folly, and more then brutiſh blockiſhnes of this people, who were ſo blinded, and euen drunken in their idolatrous ſuperſtitions, that neither Gods word, nor his works, neither his bleſſings and benefits, nor his iudgements and puniſhments, would put them in minde of God, and of thoſe duties which they owed vnto him. But how could the Iſraelites be ſaid to haue forgotten God, ſeeing ſtill they profeſſed themſelues his people, and performed ſome kind of ſeruice vnto him? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, they are ſaid to forget him, becauſe they did not reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him to be ſuch a God, as he had reuealed himſelfe in his word; namely, that he was a Spirit moſt holy, moſt pure, and infinite in all perfections, but figured and repreſented him in a little image, whom heauen, and the heauen of heauens can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not containe; and becauſe they forgat to performe vnto him that pure worſhip, which he had enioyned vnto them in his word, and in ſtead thereof, offered vnto him their owne wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip, and the idolatrous inuentions of their owne braine: and thus one is ſaid to forget another, when they forget to performe thoſe things, which the one required, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther promiſed.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the degrees of their ſinne of idolatrie. Now in the laſt place the Prophet concludeth all the former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of their ſins, &amp; denunciations of puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, by telling them, that all he had ſpoken, was not of or from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but the word of Iehouah: and this hee doth to gaine authoritie vnto the former prophecie, to confirme the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted certaintie thereof, and to moue the people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:10737:125"/> it with reuerence, and to lay it more neerely to their hearts, that thereby they might be moued to turne vnto God by true repentance.</p>

               <p>Secondly, we may obſerue, that the ſame things which the <note place="margin">The eſtate of the Church of Rome like the Church of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</note> Prophet heere condemneth in the Iſraelites, are at this day practiſed by the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For firſt they haue their <hi>Baalims,</hi> their pettie gods and patrons, whom they religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſerue &amp; worſhip; they offer vnto them incenſe, vowes, oblations; they decke and adorne not onely their Idols, but alſo themſelues, when they ſolemnize their feaſts, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch into their preſence, placing a great part of their holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and deuotion, in their outward pompe and brauerie, which are not preſcribed by God, but inuented by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, and therefore may fitly be called their own. All which
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:10737:126"/> decking and adorning of themſelues, and their Idols, they like impudent harlots vſe, that with theſe baites of outward pompe and beautie they may allure others to goe a whoring with them after their Idols: they haue alſo a long time liued in their ſpirituall adulteries, with great impudencie and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie, boaſting and glorying in their ſinne; and finally they haue ſo ſet their hearts vpon their louers, and are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent &amp; earneſt in their ſeruice, that they may be truly ſaid to haue forgotten the Lord, becauſe they do not ſo remember him as he hath reuealed himſelfe in his word; becauſe they haue forgotten to worſhip him in ſpirit and truth, and in ſtead thereof offer vnto him their owne inuentions; and alſo becauſe they vſe much more care and diligence, and ſpend much more time and labour, in the ſeruice of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> Saints, Angels, Images, and other Idols, then in the ſeruice of the true and euerliuing God. From whence wee may aſſuredly gather, that the Lord will viſite vpon them the daies of <hi>Baalim,</hi> though for a time to ſhew his own patience, and to make them the more vnexcuſable, hee deferre their iuſtly deſerued puniſhments. And therefore let al thoſe come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who would not be partakers of her plagues. Apoc. 18. 4. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apoc.</hi> 18. 4. We muſt not place our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward pompe.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, we may hence learne, to auoid the fooliſh ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition of idolaters, who place their religion in outward pompe and ſumptuous ſhewes, and to worſhip the Lord in ſpirit &amp; truth according to the preſcript forme of his word. Wherein many amongſt our ſelues may iuſtly be reproued, who thinke they haue done God good ſeruice, if on his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths they come to the Church in their beſt apparell, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly decked and adorned, when in the meane time they come with their workaday ſoules, full of worldly diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and cogitations, and altogether vnprepared and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garniſhed, without all care or conſcience, zeale or deuotion. But ſuch are to know, that the Lord will not be pleaſed with the worſhip of an Idoll, for little regardeth he the outward habite, if the heart and ſoule bee defiled, beggarly and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:10737:126"/>
               <p> Fourthly, we may, out of the order which the Prophet here <note place="margin">The idolaters progreſſe.</note> obſerueth in ſetting down their idolatrie, note the progreſſe which idolaters make in their ſinne, aſcending from one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to another till they come to the higheſt. Firſt hee ſaith, that through the naturall inclination which is in euery man, they are drawne to worſhip and ſerue their Idols. Secondly, more and more doting in their fond loue toward them, they decke and adorne both their ſtatues and images and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, being to performe worſhip vnto them, with gold, ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, iewels and pretious ornaments, that hereby they may themſelues performe ſeruice vnto them with greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and alſo allure others to ioyne with them in their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. Thirdly, hauing thus bewitched themſelues with their owne ſorceries, they goe forward in their idolatrie with great pertinacie and wilfull obſtinacie. And laſtly, they ſo inebriate themſelues with drinking in this golden cup of fornications, and are ſo wholly intent and deuoted vnto their blinde ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, that they quite forget the Lord and his true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. All which are noted in this place in the idolatrous Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites by the Prophet, and may be obſerued in the practiſe of the Papiſts in our owne daies. The conſideration whereof ſhould moue vs to flee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt allurements vnto idolatrie, and the beginnings and firſt degrees of this ſinne, for one ſteppe will bring vs to another till we come to the higheſt, namely, forgetfulneſſe of God and vtter neglect and contempt of his pure religion.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, we may obſerue, that the worſhip of the true God, <note place="margin">The worſhip of God and idols will not ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d together.</note> and the ſeruice of Idols will not poſſibly ſtand together: for aſſoone as we begin to offer incenſe vnto <hi>Baal,</hi> we forget <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houah;</hi> when we loue Idols, we ceaſe to loue the Lord; when we depend vpon them, we diſtruſt God: and this is that our Sauiour teacheth vs, Matth. 6. 24. <hi>No man can ſerue two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> &amp;c. and the Apoſtle telleth vs, that <hi>we cannot drinke of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>the cup of the Lord and the cup of diuels,</hi> &amp;c. 1. Cor. 10. 21. That <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>there is no concord betweene Chriſt and Belial,</hi> and <hi>no agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betweene the temple of God and idols,</hi> 2. Cor. 6. 15. 16. The <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 15. 16. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 2.</note> ark of God &amp; Dagon cannot ſtand together, 1. Sa. 5. 2. There
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:10737:127"/> is no <hi>halting betweene God and Baal: but if God be God, ſerue him; if Baal be god, ſerue him,</hi> 1. King. 18. 21. And therefore <note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 18. 21.</note> let vs not hearken vnto thoſe who would reconcile together Chriſt and Antichriſt, <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangell and the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, the whore of Babylon and the ſpouſe of Chriſt, Gods true religion and popiſh ſuperſtition, and ſo make a hotch potch of religion, like vnto the religion of the Samaritanes, condemned by God, 2. King. 17. 33. 41. Let vs take heed that <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 17. 33. 41.</note> we doe not to make peace on earth, proclaime warre againſt heauen, and ioyne in league with men, to fight againſt God and his truth; aſſuring our ſelues that light and darkneſſe, righteouſneſſe and vnrighteouſneſſe, God and Belial, may as well be reconciled together, as Chriſts true religion with the ſuperſtitious idolatries of the Romiſh Babylon.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, wee here learne, that not to remember the Lord to <note place="margin">They forget the Lord who doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him according to his word.</note> be ſuch an one as he hath reuealed himſelfe in his word, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together to forget him; as appeareth in the example of the Iſraelites, of whom the Lord complaineth, that they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten him, notwithſtanding they ſtill outwardly profeſſed that hee was their God and they his people, becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred and worſhipped him in their Idols. So they who forget any of Gods attributes, whereby in his word he hath made himſelfe knowne vnto vs, forget God himſelfe, for his attributes are his eſſence; as the wiſedome of God is the wiſe God, the infinitenes of God is the infinite God, the loue of God is the louing God, &amp;c. And therefore, that God which they remember is not the true <hi>Iehouah,</hi> but an idoll of their owne making. If then we only remember, that God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, and doe not remember that hee is alſo iuſt (as it is the cuſtome of carnall ſecure men) wee make an idoll vnto our ſelues, but forget the true God; and ſo in like manner wee forget the Lord, if with deſperate ſinners wee remember his iuſtice, and forget his mercie. And the like may be ſaid of his omnipotence, omnipreſence, al-ſufficiencie, prouidence, and the reſt of his attributes.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we may here obſerue that the Prophet concludeth <note place="margin">The authority of Gods word countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth his Miniſters in their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage.</note> all his reprehenſions of their ſins and threatning of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:10737:127"/> by telling them that whatſoeuer he had deliuered, was not his owne, but the word of the Lord; whereby he confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth his former denunciations of iudgements, and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſureth them, that how vnlikely ſoeuer they thought them, yet they ſhould moſt vndoubtedly come to paſſe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was the word which truth it ſelf had ſpoken: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they would eſcape them, there was no dallying nor delaying of the time, but ſpeedily they muſt preuent them, by turning vnto God by true repentance. And ſecondly, hereby hee auerteth all their malice and diſpleaſure from himſelfe, ſeeing theſe heauie tidings were not the deuices of his owne braine, but the word of the Lord, of which onely he was the Embaſſadour: and therefore if they would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking any exceptions, patiently heare an Embaſſadour ſent from an earthly King, denouncing warre againſt them, becauſe iniury or violence offered to an Embaſſadour is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the law of nations; how much more ſhould they heare him without all malice or preiudice, ſeeing he only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered the embaſſage, which the Lord of hoſts had put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his mouth?</p>
               <p>From which example Gods Miniſters may learne to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer nothing to the people, but the pure word of the Lord, which they are boldly to vtter, though it ſeeme neuer ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable to fleſh and blood; for as much as hee who hath ſpoken it will moſt ſurely accompliſh it; otherwiſe they ſhall commit the ſinne of <hi>Ionas,</hi> who when the word of the Lord was put into his mouth, durſt not deliuer it, but being ſent to Niniue, fled to Tarſhiſh, and in this reſpect make leſſe conſcience of their calling, then <hi>Balaam,</hi> as appeareth Numb. 24. 13. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Numb.</hi> 24. 13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo likewiſe the people may here learne with patience to heare Gods Miniſters, though they denounce Gods hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie iudgements againſt their ſinnes, if they deliuer nothing but that which they haue warrant for out of Gods written word, ſeeing they are bound in conſcience of their calling to deliuer their embaſſage, and ſeeing in reſiſting them, they rebell againſt God himſelfe; neither is it poſſible that any
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:10737:128"/> ſhould be obedient vnto God, who maligne his meſſengers for his meſſage ſake.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, when Gods iudgements are denounced out of his Word againſt them for their ſinnes, they are not to neglect them, but to lay them to heart, that therby they may be moued to vnfained repentance, notwithſtanding they ſee no appearance of danger, or any likely meanes wherby ſuch puniſhments may bee deriued vnto them, ſeeing the Lord, whoſe Word it is which we heare, is able to effect it, though to vs it ſeeme impoſſible.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <p>ANd ſo much concerning the firſt part of this Chapter, containing in it legall threatnings, denounced againſt the people of Iſrael, for their ſinnes. Now we are to ſpeake of the ſecond part, containing in it Gods gratious promiſes of diuers excellent benefits, which hee would beſtow vpon his Church and people, the true Iſrael of God in the time of the Goſpell. The firſt whereof, is their effectuall calling and conuerſion vnto God, wherby they are freed out of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall captiuitie of Satan, choſen out of the world, and made Gods Church and peculiar people. The ſecond is true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, wrought in their hearts by the glad tidings of the Goſpell, made effectuall by the inward working of his holy Spirit. Both which are contained, Verſ. 14. in theſe words: <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſ. </seg>14</label> 
                  <hi>Therefore behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſpeake friendly</hi> (or confortablie) <hi>vnto her.</hi> Where the <note place="margin">The expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</note> Lord ſheweth, that howſoeuer being prouoked vnto wrath by their ſinnes, he would execute vpon them all thoſe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments before threatned, yet he would not retaine his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger for euer, but in the end, when he had laid vpon them ſuch afflictions as were ſufficient, meaſuring their proportion by the rule of his fatherly loue, and not according to the hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſnes of their ſins, he would turne all their chaſtiſements to their good, and gathering them into his Church, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie his mercies vpon them.</p>
               <p>But let vs come to the words themſelues; wherein we are to conſider firſt the context, and ſecondly the benefits pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed:
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:10737:128"/> the context in theſe words, <hi>Therefore behold.</hi> This may ſeeme a ſtrange kind of conſequence; for in the former verſe he had ſet downe their obſtinacie in their groſſe idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and that they were ſo wholly deuoted to their Idols, that they had quite forgotten the true God,: and now hee preſently inferreth hereupon, that therefore he would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure her, and ſpeake comfortablie vnto her. But howſoeuer this may ſeeme but a bad inference, if we regard their ſinnes, vpon the recitall whereof it ſhould rather haue followed, that therefore they ſhould haue ſuch puniſhments inflicted vpon them as their ſinnes had deſerued; yet it hath good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance, if we reſpect Gods infinite mercie, and his eternall purpoſe, whereby he hath of his free grace and vndeſerued goodnes, ordained to call them, who belong to his election, out of their ſinnes, that being conuerted they may alſo bee ſaued. As though he ſhould haue ſaid, Seeing they follow their idols with delightfull obſtinacie, and haue altogether forgotten me: and ſeeing their hearts are ſo blind and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate, that all my puniſhments will not reclaime them: and finally, ſeeing it is not my purpoſe to giue them ouer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and to ſuffer them to run headlong to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; therefore I will not let them go forward in their owne courſes, nor be ruled by their owne obſtinate wils, for then they would neuer returne vnto me, but I wil work vpon their hard harts, by my Word and Spirit, alluring and perſwading them to leaue their idols and falſe worſhip, and to returne vnto me, that they may worſhip me according to my reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will, and ſubmit themſelues vnto me in all holy obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>And becauſe this is a wonderfull mercie of God, farre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all humane conceite, and therfore not lightly and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to be paſſed ouer, hence it is that the note of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is added, <hi>Therefore behold,</hi> that we might more careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerue, and obſeruing praiſe and magnifie this vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able goodnes of God, who by our ſinnes is moued rather to pitie, then to puniſh vs.</p>
               <p>And ſo much for the context. The firſt benefit here promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:10737:129"/> is their effectuall calling, whereby working vpon their hearts with his Word and Spirit, hee would allure and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them to forſake their idolatrie, and to come out of the ſeruice of ſin and Satan, that they might become true mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Church, and liue in holy obedience vnto his will, as his true ſubiects and ſeruants. All which is contained in theſe words, <hi>I wil allure her, and bring her into the wilderneſſe:</hi> where he alludeth to their firſt deliuerie out of the captiuitie, and from the blind idolatrie of Egypt, when as firſt he allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and perſwaded them, by his ſeruants <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> to deſire earneſtly to come out of that bondage, that they <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 30. 31.</note> might become his ſeruants and people; and hauing ſo incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their hearts, hee brought them out with a ſtrong arme, and led them into the wilderneſſe, where he made his coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with them, and afterwards brought them into the land of promiſe, where he multiplied vpon them his manifold benefits, as it followeth in the next verſe.</p>
               <p>So the Lord by his ſeruants and Miniſters doth worke in the ignorant minds and ſtubborne hearts of thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to his election, a deſire to come out of the thraldome of the ſpirituall <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Satan; and hauing thus inclined and allured them by his powerfull Spirit, applying vnto them the benefits of Chriſts death and obedience, hee deliuereth them out of this miſerable bondage: notwithſtanding, hee doth not preſently bring them from Egypt to the heauenly Canaan, but cauſeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to paſſe firſt thorow the wilderneſſe of this wicked world; where, howſoeuer hee prouideth for them, and cauſeth their ſafetie by his almightie protection, ſo that they are now in far better eſtate, then whileſt they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the ſpirituall captiuitie of ſinne and Satan, yet they are there afflicted with many miſeries, hunger, thirſt, heate, cold, ſickneſſe and diſeaſes, with inward mutinies and ſedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelues, and with the outward malice and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the ſpirituall Cananites, their worldly and wicked e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; with which hauing a while exerciſed and humbled them, and withall wrought in their hearts an earneſt deſire to come into their heauenly countrey in the end he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:10737:129"/> them into the ſpirituall and new <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> The like allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> hath, ſpeaking of this ſpirituall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance through Chriſt: Eſa. 11. 15. 16. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 11. 15. 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas then hee ſaith, <hi>I will allure her;</hi> the meaning is, that by his word and holy Spirit, he will bring them to true repentance, effectually perſwading them to leaue the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of ſinne and Satan, and to adioyne themſelues to his Church and familie; and more ſpecially that he will incline them and change their obſtinate reſolution in following their idols, and make them pliable to holy obedience, that forſaking their falſe gods and idolatrous worſhip, they may worſhip the only <hi>Iehouah</hi> in ſpirit and truth. Where ſtill hee continueth the allegorie of mariage, as though hee would ſay, Her louers, that is, her idols haue inticed her, with many baits to commit ſpirituall whoredome with them; but they ſhall no longer ſeduce and abuſe her, for I her louing huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, offering vnto her innumerable benefits, and eternall happineſſe, will allure and perſwade her, to forſake her lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and to returne vnto me. And whereas hee ſaith that hee will bring <hi>her into the wilderneſſe;</hi> the meaning is, that they ſhall not paſſe preſently out of their miſerable ſeruitude of ſinne and Satan into the heauenly Canaan, but ſhal for a time make their abode in the wildernes of this world, where they ſhall be tried with many calamities and afflictions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with being throughly humbled, they ſhall enter into their heauenly countrie, according to that, Act. 14. 22. <hi>Wee muſt</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Others tranſlate theſe words thus; <hi>I will allure her after I haue led her into the wilderneſſe:</hi> as though the time were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in implied, when the Lord would perſwade and conuert his people, namely, after he had firſt brought them into the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of affliction, and thereby throughly humbled them. But howſoeuer this expoſition may be thought not repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to any thing in the text, yet I rather embrace the other, as being more plaine and ſimple, without the changing of any word from his owne ſignification, and alſo becauſe it more fitly anſwereth to the deliuerance of the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:10737:130"/> vnto which it is manifeſt he here alludeth: and laſtly, becauſe it well agreeth with the like place, Ezech. 20. 34. 35. 37. where the ſame alluſion is vſed. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezeth.</hi> 20. 34. 35.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And this is the firſt benefit. The ſecond is expreſſed in theſe words; <hi>and I will ſpeake friendly,</hi> or <hi>comfortably vnto her.</hi> The originall hath it thus; <hi>and I will ſpeake vnto her heart:</hi> by which is ſignified that he would ſpeak vnto her ſuch plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and acceptable words, as ſhould repleniſh her hart with true ioy and comfort, though they were in the middeſt of the wilderneſſe of affliction. And thus this phraſe is vſed, Eſa. 40. <note place="margin">

Theſſ. 2. 11.</p>
               <p>The meaning therefore is, that as when hee had brought his people into the wilderneſſe, he ſpake vnto them, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his law, vnto which were annexed manifold promiſes of his great benefits, by which the people for the preſent were ſomewhat comforted in the middeſt of the afflictions which they ſuffered in the wilderneſſe; ſo hee would in the time of the Goſpell, after hee had deliuered his people out of the thraldome of ſin and Satan, ſpeake comfortably vnto them whileſt they were vexed and moleſted with manifold affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the wilderneſſe of the world, that ſo being filled with conſolation, they might patiently and cheerefully through the middeſt of theſe miſeries march towards their heauenly countrie. Now this ſpeech of comfort of which he here ſpeaketh, is nothing elſe but the glad tidings of the Goſpell, wherein we are aſſured of our deliuerance out of our ſpirituall thraldome vnto ſinne and Satan, of the free pardon and remiſſion of all our ſinnes, of our peace and reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God, and of euerlaſting happineſſe which Chriſt by his death and merits hath purchaſed for vs. The which ſpeech of the Goſpell is much more effectuall for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and conſolation, then the ſpeech of the Law. For then the Lord ſpake to the eare, but now hee ſpeaketh to the heart; that comfort was but for the preſent, becauſe being groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:10737:130"/> vpon the condition of their obedience to the law, that prouing impoſſible their comfort was changed into horror and deſpaire; but this is eternall, hauing his foundation not in our owne workes and worthineſſe, but vpon the free mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of God, and merits of Chriſt, apprehended by a liuely faith. And laſtly, becauſe the Goſpell offereth vnto vs farre greater benefits, then we are promiſed in the Law, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore filleth our hearts with greater comfort. And of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 2. Cor. 1. 3. 4. 5. 7. 6. Act. 9. 31. <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 3. 4. 5. <hi>and</hi> 7. 6. <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 31. <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 25.</note> Of which our Sauiour Chriſt is the principall cauſe, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is called the conſolation of Iſrael: Luk. 2. 25.</p>
               <p>And ſo much for the meaning of the words. The doctrines <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The Do∣ctrines. </seg>
                  </label> which from hence ariſe are theſe. Firſt, we may obſerue, that howſoeuer the Lord being prouoked to iuſt diſpleaſure by <note place="margin">The Lord doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his anger for euer.</note> the ſinnes of the people, doth not onely threaten his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but alſo inflicteth deſerued puniſhments, yet he doth not retaine his anger for euer, nor yet delighteth in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of his Church; but hauing with his fatherly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements humbled them and brough them vnto vnfained repentance, hee turneth his frownes into ſmiles, his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings into promiſes, his iudgements into mercie, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing their afflictions and puniſhments, hee multiplieth vpon them his gratious benefits: For hee is <hi>ſlow to anger, but abundant in goodneſſe and truth,</hi> Exod. 34. 6. 7. <hi>He will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6. 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 8. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>chide, neither keepeth he his anger for euer,</hi> Pſal. 103. 8. 9. And though he afflict vs, yet <hi>he dealeth not with vs after our ſinnes, nor rewardeth vs according to our iniquities,</hi> as it is verſe 10. <hi>neither retaineth he his anger for euer, becauſe mercie plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him,</hi> as it is Mic. 7. 18. An example wherof we haue in this <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Micha</hi> 7. 18.</note> place, where after his ſharpe threatnings he adioyneth gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious promiſes: likewiſe in the Iſraelites in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time of the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; in the Iewes lead captiue into Babylon, and afterwards reſtored: but there needs but few examples to confirme that, of which we our ſelues haue ſo manifold experience, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, out of the connexion of this with the former <note place="margin">The mercie of God infinitely exceedeth the mercie of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> verſe, wee may obſerue how infinitly the mercie of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the mercie of man: for whereas man being offended
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:10737:131"/> maketh this concluſion, becauſe hee hath iniured me, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will reuenge my ſelfe vpon him, the Lord contrariwiſe in this place concludeth, that becauſe the people had grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly prouoked his anger by their obſtinacie in their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and forgetfulneſſe of him, therefore hee would allure them to repentance by his benefits and ſpeake comfortably vnto them; as though he ſhould ſay, Though they be ſo pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhly obſtinate, that they care not wilfully and deſperately to go on in their ſins to their vtter deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet I wil not ſet my wiſedome againſt their follie, nor ſuffer their ſtubborne willes to croſſe my will and eternall counſell, but I will now begin to take care of them, ſeeing they will take no care of themſelues; and becauſe they haue nothing profited by all my threatnings and puniſhments, I will mollifie their hard hearts, and incline their ſtubborne and rebellious willes with my gratious promiſes and mercifull benefits. So that the Lord behaueth himſelfe like a tender hearted father, and we demeane our ſelues like ſtubborne children; though our ſtiffe harts relent not vnder his corrections, yet his heart yearneth at our paine, and he is ſooner wearie of puniſhing, then we of ſuffering puniſhment; and when his chaſtiſements will not ouercome our malitiouſneſſe, hee laboureth to ouercome vs with his goodneſſe and kindneſſe: and as the carefull and louing Phyſition is not moued by the deſperate wilfulneſſe of his impatient patient, both refuſing that which is good for him, and eagerly ſeeking that which is hurtfull and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious, to giue him ouer to himſelfe, but vſeth the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care and diligence, by how much the leſſe hee ſeeth that hee careth for himſelfe; and when he heareth for all his loue and labour nothing but diſtempered and railing ſpeeches from his patient, is rather thereby mooued to pitie then reuenge: ſo dealeth the Lorde with vs who are ſicke in ſinne, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The vſe which we are to make hereof is, that we not onely praiſe the Lord for this his mercie and goodneſſe, but alſo that wee ſtriue to follow his example, not ſeeking reuenge when wee are iniured, but ſtriuing to ouercome euill with
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:10737:131"/> goodnes, as the Apoſtle exhorteth, Rom. 12. 19. 21. and ſo <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 19. 21.</note> ſhall wee indeed approue our ſelues to bee the children of our heauenly father, as our Sauiour teacheth vs, Matth. 5. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 44. 45.</note> 44. 45.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we may heere learne, that neither Gods terrible <note place="margin">The Lord on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leadeth to repentance.</note> threatnings, nor ſharpe afflictions, are auaileable to worke in our hearts true repentance, vnleſſe the Lord allure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline our harts with the inward operation of his holy Spirit, for the more God puniſheth, the more naturally we repine and murmure; and our ſteely hearts like the anuill, with more blowes do waxe the harder, and ſooner will we breake then bow, vnleſſe the Lord incline vs: as appeareth in the example of <hi>Pharaoh, Saul,</hi> the Iſraelites, Eſay 1. 5. and in our owne experience. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſay</hi> 1. 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, we here learne, that the Lord is the principal and <note place="margin">The Lord is the ſole cauſe of our conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> ſole cauſe of our conuerſion, for vntill he incline and allure our hearts to leaue our ſinnes, and to returne vnto him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his promiſes nor his threatnings, neither his benefits nor his puniſhments will worke in our hearts vnfained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. And as this is manifeſt in this place, ſo alſo in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers other places of Scripture. <hi>Ieremie</hi> telleth vs, that the <hi>Black-moore may as well change his skinne, or the Leopard his ſpots,</hi> as we can do good, that are accuſtomed to euill, Ier. 13. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 23.</note> 23. And therefore the Lord when he would conuert his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſaith, that <hi>he will giue them a new ſpirit, and taking the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart out of their bodies, will giue them a heart of fleſh,</hi> Ezech. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 11. 19. 36. 26.</note> 11. 19. ſo Ezech. 36. 26. And our Sauiour Chriſt teacheth vs, that no man <hi>can come vnto him, except the Father draw him,</hi> Ioh. 6. 44. the Apoſtle likewiſe ſaith, that before our conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 44.</note> we are not only ſick, but euen dead in our ſins, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no more able to raiſe vp our ſelues from the death of ſin, to the life of righteouſnes, then a dead man to riſe out of his graue, Epheſ. 2. 1. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be demaunded, that if this be ſo, to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſerueth the miniſterie of the Word, and exhortations to repentance, ſeeing he ſpeaketh in vaine, that perſwadeth a
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:10737:132"/> dead man to riſe to life? I anſwere, that the miniſterie of the Word, is the meanes of our conuerſion, which the Lord by the inward operation of his holy Spirit, maketh effectuall for this purpoſe, in the hearts of all his elect. Theſe exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions therefore vnto repentance are not in vaine, ſeeing the Lord worketh not vpon men, as vpon ſtocks and ſtones, but as vpon reaſonable creatures, whom he exhorteth to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and withall working vpon their hearts, by his holy Spirit, inclineth them to performe that vnto which hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth them; and as he outwardly commandeth, ſo inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he inclineth, and enableth them to do that which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth: and hence it is, that our Sauiour ſaith, that the words which he ſpake were <hi>Spirit and life,</hi> Ioh. 6. 63. becauſe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 63.</note> they were not like the law, which only commanded, and did not enable to yeeld obedience, but being made effectuall by the Spirit, which gaue life vnto them, they both enioyned and wrought in vs true obedience.</p>
               <p>And this the Prophet implieth, when as he ſaith, that the Lord will allure or perſwade them to turne vnto him; ſo that his word is the inſtrument, whereby he doth not only moue vs, but throughly perſwade vs to true repentance: and this we may ſee verified, Act. 13. 43. in the example of <hi>Lydia,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 43. 16. 14. 18. 4. 28. 23.</note> chap. 16. 14. 18. 4. 28. 23.</p>
               <p>The vſe which we are to make hereof is, that we yeeld vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him the whole praiſe of our conuerſion, and not with the Papiſts ſhare with him, aſcribing part of the glorie vnto him, and part to our ſelues.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſeeing it is the work of God alone, we muſt not reſt in our owne power and ſtrength, for the effecting of this great worke, but we muſt call vpon God for this grace, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Church, Lament. 5. 21. <hi>Conuert vs O Lord, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lament.</hi> 5. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>we ſhall be conuerted:</hi> much leſſe are we to deferre our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion from day to day, as though it were a matter which we can eaſilie performe at our owne pleaſure, but conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it is the Lords free gift, let vs receiue it when he offereth it, and turne vnto him, when he allureth and perſwadeth vs to repentance.</p>
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:10737:132"/>
               <p> And ſo likewiſe becauſe it is the Lord alone, who allureth and turneth the heart, it behooueth al thoſe who would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert others, not to reſt too much in the force of their owne eloquence, or the ſtrength of their owne reaſons, but to ioyne with their earneſt labour and endeauour, humble and hartie prayers vnto almightie God, deſiring the aſſiſtance of his holy Spirit, by which alone their perſwaſions are made effectuall to perſwade.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, we here learne, not to expect preſently vpon our <note place="margin">We muſt not expect ſecure peace after our conuerſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> conuerſion vnto God, and adioyning to the Church, ſecure peace and flouriſhing proſperitie: for after the Lord hath allured and perſwaded vs to turne vnto him, he leadeth vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wilderneſſe of affliction, before he bringeth vs to reſt in our heauenly Canaan. The world that hated our head Chriſt, will alſo hate vs which are his members, as our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath told vs, Ioh. 16. 18. 19. Satan continually aſſayleth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 18. 19.</note> vs, labouring to regaine vs into his thraldome: and though we had no outward moleſtation, yet our inbred enemie the fleſh will not let vs want comberſome trouble and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And therefore let vs not look for a paradiſe in this world, which was appointed for our pilgrimage, nor expect victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and triumph, before wee haue vndertaken and finiſhed our warfare, neither let vs imagine that we ſhall be confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable vnto Chriſt in glorie, before we haue been conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto him in his afflictions, or that we ſhall raigne with <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. 18.</note> him, before we haue ſuffered with him; or finally, that wee can paſſe into the kingdome of heauen, but by many afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and tribulations. Examples hereof we haue in <hi>Adam,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Abel, Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob, Dauid,</hi> and in the Apoſtles, yea in our Sauiour Chriſt himſelfe, who firſt ſuffered, and ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into glory. And this is that which our Sauiour hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 26.</note> vs of in many places, Mat. 10. 17. &amp; 26. 38. 16. 24. 24. 9. Iohn 15. 20. &amp; 16. 20. 1. Theſſ. 3. 3. 4. 2. Tim. 3. 12. And therefore before we giue our names vnto Chriſt, and make profeſſion of his Goſpell, but let vs, as he counſelleth vs, ſit downe, and with the wiſe builder count the coſt, leſt hauing begun this great worke, and not being able or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:10737:133"/> to finiſh it, we expoſe our ſelues to deriſion. Let vs with <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 28. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 8.</note> the Apoſtle reſolue to go forward in our Chriſtian courſe, by honor and diſhonor, euill report and good report, and make full account, if we will be followers of Chriſt, to waite vpon him with our croſſe on our backes: otherwiſe, if we embrace Chriſt and his Goſpell for worldly reſpects, we will be ready to forſake him when we ſee our hopes fruſtrate, with <hi>Iudas, Simon Magus,</hi> and <hi>Demas.</hi> And though for a time we heare the Word with gladnes, and bring forth the blade of a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious profeſſion, yet when the ſunne of affliction ariſeth, it will wither, and in the time of temptation we ſhall fall away, Luk. 8. 13. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And theſe are the doctrines, which we are to obſerue out <note place="margin">The Lord is the ſole au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all true comfort and only giueth it to the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 3. 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 5.</note> of the firſt benefit promiſed in the former part of the verſe. Now out of the ſecond benefit, namely, the comfort and conſolation of the Church, promiſed in the latter part of this verſe, theſe things are to be obſerued.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we here learne, that the Lord is the author of all true comfort, which hee imparteth onely vnto thoſe, whom hee hath firſt allured and perſwaded, that is, effectually called: for where there is no peace with God, nor peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, there is no ſound comfort; but there is no ſuch peace till we be conuerted, and reconciled vnto God, according to that, Eſa. 57. 21. Howſoeuer therfore worldlings may laugh <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſay</hi> 57. 21.</note> from the teeth outward, yet they haue no ſound comfort, till the Lord conuert them, and ſpeake comfortablie vnto their hearts, their mirth being continually checked with the pangs of an euil conſcience, which continually ſummoneth them to appeare before Gods iudgement ſeate. No Traitour being condemned, can hartely reioyce, till he haue his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The vſe which we are to make hereof, is, that wee doe not ſeek for ioy &amp; conſolation in worldly vanities, in the meane time being deſtitute of the comfort of Gods Spirit; but firſt let vs labour for aſſurance of our true conuerſion, and then being at peace with God, wee ſhall be repleniſhed with the ioy of the holy Ghoſt. And ſecondly, ſeeing there is no true
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:10737:133"/> comfort till God the author of conſolation ſpeake vnto our hearts, let vs not ſeeke it elſewhere, but with the Apoſtle beg it at Gods hand by prayer: 2. Theſſ. 2. 16. 17. <note place="margin">2. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 16. 17. God afflicteth his, but doth not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme them with miſeries.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, wee heere learne, that howſoeuer the people of God after their conuerſion are lead into the wilderneſſe of affliction, yet they are not left deſolate to be ouerwhelmed with their miſeries: for though all other helps faile, the Lord himſelfe will ſpeake comfortably vnto them, and keep them from fainting or ſinking vnder the heauieſt waight of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Neither in truth is there any miſerie ſo intolerable, but it may be borne with patience and ioyfulneſſe of them, vnto whom the Lord hath ſpoken by his word and Spirit, aſſuring them that they are reconciled vnto him, and in his loue and fauour, that they haue their ſinnes pardoned, and haue eſcaped condemnation, that all things ſhall worke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the beſt; and that theſe <hi>momentanie and light af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall cauſe vnto them a ſuperexcellent and eternall weight of glorie.</hi> Examples hereof we haue in <hi>Abraham, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Dauid, Elias,</hi> in the Apoſtles, Act. 5. 11. in the Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 11. 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 6.</note> who <hi>receiued the word with much affliction, and with ioy of the holy Ghost,</hi> 1. Theſſ. 1. 6. And finally in all the faithfull, who being iuſtified through faith, and being at peace with God, doe not onely <hi>reioyce vnder the hope of the glorie of God, but alſo in tribulation,</hi> Rom. 5. 1. 2. 3. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. 2. 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore when we heare of, or feele ſharpe affliction for the profeſſion of the Goſpell, let vs not bee daunted or diſcouraged, for the Lord when he hath brought vs into this wilderneſſe will ſpeake comfortably vnto vs, he will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vs to be tempted aboue our power, but will giue a good iſſue to all our trials, and will ſo arme vs with inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 13.</note> that we ſhall eaſily indure all outward afflictions. So that when we are brought into the wilderneſſe of affliction, ſo far are we to be from doubting of Gods loue and fauour, and of the comfort of his Spirit, that then aboue all other times wee are ſurely to expect them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we are to obſerue the meanes whereby this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort <note place="margin">The meanes whereby God comforteth vs.</note> is deriued vnto vs, namely, by Gods ſpeaking vnto vs;
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:10737:134"/> the which ſpeech is twofold, the outward ſpeech of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, containing the glad tidings of our reconciliation with God, and all the gratious promiſes of life and ſaluation in Chriſt; and the inward ſpeech of the Spirit, crying in our hearts, <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> and <hi>teſtifying vnto our ſpirits that we are</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 15. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>the ſonnes of God.</hi> And hence it is that the Spirit is called <hi>the Comforter,</hi> Ioh. 16. 7. and our ſpirituall comfort the <hi>conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 7.</note>

In the benefit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed is ſet down: firſt, the benefit it ſelfe: ſecondly, the time when God beſtoweth it: and thirdly, the end why it is giuen and receiued. The benefit it ſelfe is expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>I will giue her her vineyards, and the valley of Achor.</hi> Where the, Lord oppoſeth his benefits here promiſed to the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before denounted, verſ. 12. for there he threatneth to take away her vines and figge trees, and here he promiſeth to reſtore them againe, and that with aduantage, as is ſignified by the change of the word: for there hee threatneth to take
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:10737:135"/> away her vines, and here he promiſeth to giue her vineyards, which conſiſt of manie vines; the which alſo is expreſſed in the plurall number, to intimate their multitude and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</p>
               <p>Now vnder this one kind ſynecdochically are to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood all other corporall benefits, of which before hee had threatned to ſtrip them, and all other of like nature, as before I haue ſhewed: and much more by theſe types and ſhadowes we are allegorically to vnderſtand Gods ſpirituall gifts and graces, which vnder them are vſually ſignified, the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying himſelfe to the rudeneſſe &amp; ignorance of the Church in the time of her infancie, who could not conceiue of Gods ſpirituall benefits, vnleſſe they were after a palpable manner deſcribed and ſhadowed vnto them.</p>
               <p>And amongſt many particulars hee eſpecially promiſeth vineyards, the better to expreſſe Gods large bountie and the Churches great plentie: for bread and foode are neceſſarie for the preſeruation of life, but wine aboundeth, the vſe whereof ſeruing not only for ſuſtentation, but alſo for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and delight; as the Pſalmiſt ſheweth, Pſal. 104. 14. 15. there he ſaith, that God giueth <hi>hearbes and bread for the vſe</hi>

               <p>He ſaith further, that he will <hi>giue her the valley of Achor.</hi> Where he ſtill continueth the former Allegorie, alluding to the deliuerance of the people of Iſrael out of Egypt, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that they had been tried a long time in the wilderneſſe, they were at laſt brought into the borders of Canaan, and ouercame the citie Iericho, where <hi>Achan</hi> ſtealing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate thing, was by <hi>Ioſua</hi> and the people brought into a valley neere adioyning, where he and his familie were ſtoned; which valley afterwards <hi>Ioſua</hi> named the valley of <hi>Achor,</hi> becauſe the people of Iſrael being ouerthrowne by
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:10737:135"/> the men of Ai, were exceedingly troubled, ſo that their harts melted like water, as appeareth, Ioſ. 7. 5. the which reaſon of <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioſ.</hi> 7. 5. 25. 26.</note> the name, <hi>Ioſua</hi> himſelfe giueth, verſ. 25. 26. as it alſo ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth, being deriued from <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>turbauit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But howſoeuer this valley of Achor, was to the people of Iſrael for a time a valley of trouble, yet afterwards it was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them a place of great ioy and comfort, both becauſe they obtained victorie againſt their enemies, the men of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and alſo becauſe they enioyed this valley, which was exceeding fertill and fruitfull, eſpecially of vines and fruitfull trees.</p>
               <p>Wheras then the Lord promiſeth to giue vnto his Church the valley of Achor, the meaning is, that as the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, after they had wandered in the wilderneſſe 40. years, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of corne, wine, oyle, and all other benefits, ſauing thoſe which the Lord miraculouſly beſtowed; and in this reſpect, howſoeuer they were preſerued by God, yet had they ſtil the image of death before them, and after they had been tried, and humbled by many afflictions, were in Gods appointed time brought into the confines of the land of Canaan, the countrie of Iericho, and the valley of Achor, where they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed all theſe bleſſings with great comfort and contentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo that in reſpect of the great and ſudden alteration they ſeemed newly tranſported from death to life: So the Church in the time of the Goſpell, after ſhe is reconciled vnto God, and hath paſſed thorow a wilderneſſe of affliction, for her triall and humiliation, is not only ſuſtained in the middeſt of all her troubles, with the inward comfort of Gods Spirit, but alſo is further aſſured of Gods loue, by the outward teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of his manifold benefits, wherewith ſhe is repleniſhed with ſuch ioy and conſolation, that ſhee ſeemeth vnto her ſelfe reſtored from the death of ſorrow and miſerie, to the life of comfort and happines.</p>
               <p>But yet whileſt ſhe remaineth in the valley of Achor, and but in the borders of the heauenly Canaan; howſoeuer ſhee hath great cauſe of ioy and contentment, in regard of the manifold benefits which God beſtoweth vpon her, yet is her ioy often intermixed with ſorrow and trouble, through that
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:10737:136"/> curſed <hi>Achan</hi> the fleſh, which eagerly coueting the pleaſures of ſinne, and the golden baites of wickednes, is thereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured to ſinne, and to prouoke Gods wrath, by ſeaſing vpon vnlawfull pleaſures and profits accurſed by God: by which inward rebell ſhee is betrayed vnto her outward enemies, thoſe curſed Cananites, the world and the diuell, ſo that for a time they preuaile againſt her. But yet in the end ſhe hath an happie iſſue out of all her afflictions: for as when <hi>Achan</hi> was ſtoned, <hi>Iſrael</hi> hauing hereby appeaſed Gods wrath, obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a famous victory againſt the men of Ai, ſo when the fleſh is mortified which betrayed vs, we obtaine a glorious victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ouer the world and the diuell, and ſo enter into a full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the heauenly Canaan.</p>
               <p>And thus appeareth the great ſimilitude, which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the paſſage of the children of Iſrael out of Egypt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the land of promiſe, and our paſſage out of the ſpirituall Egypt, the kingdome of ſinne and Satan, into the heauenly Canaan, the true countrie and inheritance of all the Saints, which moued the Lord allegorically to allude vnto it in this place, as alſo Eſay 65. 10. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſay</hi> 65. 10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And this is the benefit here promiſed. The ſecond thing ſpecified, is the time when the Lord would beſtow it, in this phraſe, <hi>from thence,</hi> which in the Scriptures is ſometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the time, and ſometime to the place, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly here it is diuerſly interpreted, by ſome, of the place, referring it to the deſert; namely, that as ſoone as they came out of the wilderneſſe of affliction, they ſhould enter into this valley of pleaſure: by others, of the time, vnderſtanding it thus; from thence forward, or as ſoone as I haue brought her thorow the wilderneſſe, and haue repleniſhed her with the inward comfort of my Spirit, I will giue her a reall aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of my loue, and not only ſpeake comfortablie vnto her heart, by my word and Spirit, but alſo in effect and deed, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure her further of my loue and fauour, by multiplying vpon her my mercies and manifold benefits. The which interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is not much different from the other, but the rather to be embraced, becauſe it hath better dependancie with the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:10737:136"/> former benefit: for as ſoone as the Lord hath inwardly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted his people by his word and Spirit, then preſently hee giueth them a true ſenſe of his loue and fauour, by beſtowing vpon them innumerable benefits, ſpirituall and temporall.</p>
               <p>The third thing heere expreſſed, is the end why God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, and the Church receiueth theſe his gifts and graces, not onely that ſhee may haue by them ioy and comfort in their preſent vſe, but that they may ſerue as pledges and earneſt penies, to confirme their hope and aſſurance of the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of eternall happines, the which is ſignified by this phraſe, <hi>For the doore of hope.</hi> For that is ſaid to be the doore of hope, which giueth entrance vnto hope, by offering ſome aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that we ſhall obtaine the thing hoped for. As therefore the Lord gaue to the people of Iſrael the valley of Achor, that it ſhould be vnto them a doore of hope, becauſe the poſſeſſion of the borders was a pledge vnto them, that they ſhould enioy the whole land of promiſe: ſo the manifold benefits which the Lord beſtoweth vpon the faithfull, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt they be in the borders of Canaan, the Church militant, are vnto them a doore of hope, being aſſured pledges, that after we haue a while fought with our ſpirituall enemies, wee ſhall haue full poſſeſſion of the heauenly Canaan, and the new Ieruſalem.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the benefits which are here allegorically promiſed. Now the reaſon why the Lord ſpeaking of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall deliuerance and happines of his people, alludeth to their temporall deliuerance out of Egypt, and entrance into the land of Canaan; was firſt, that hereby he might ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then their faith in the full aſſurance of his promiſes, ſeeing they had alreadie experience of his truth, power, mercy, and goodnes in their former deliuerance, when as the grieuous ſins, and great vnworthines of their forefathers, could not moue him to change his purpoſe, nor fruſtrate his word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his couenant was grounded, not vpon their deſerts, but vpon his owne vndeſerued loue, and meere good will. And ſecondly, in promiſing new benefits, he doth by this alluſion put them in minde of the old, that by the remembrance of
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:10737:137"/> theſe, and hope of the other, they might be moued to true thankfulnes and obedience.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to bee conſidered in this verſe, is the Churches ioy and thankfulneſſe, in the preſent fruition of Gods gifts, and future hope of greater benefits, ſignified in theſe words, <hi>And ſhe ſhal ſing there as in the daies of her youth, and as in the day when as ſhe came vp out of the land of Egypt.</hi> In which words is expreſſed the Churches ioy and thankfulnes, together with the place or time thereof; their ioy and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes is ſignified by their ſinging of praiſes vnto God, the author of all theſe benefits, which continuing in the former allegorie and alluſion, he compareth to that reioycing, and praiſing God, which the Iſraelites vſed after their deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance out of Egypt, when as they ſaw <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie drowned in the red ſea, of which we may reade, Exod. 15. vnder which ſpeciall we are generally to vnderſtand all <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.</note> their reioycing and ſongs of praiſes, for all Gods benefits, eſpecially when they were in the valley of Achor, and had entred into the poſſeſſion of the land of promiſe.</p>
               <p>Whereas then he ſaith, that ſhe ſhall ſing as in the daies of her youth and childhood: we are hereby to vnderſtand the time of her comming out of the Egyptian ſeruitude, which is fitly compared to the birth and infancie of the Church, as before I haue ſhewed in verſ. 3. and therefore the words following are added, <hi>exegetic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s,</hi> by way of expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on plainly expreſſing what is meant by the time of her child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, namely, the day when ſhe aſcended out of the land of Egypt.</p>
               <p>The meaning therfore of theſe words is this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iſrael after their deliuerance out of the Egyptian bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and after that they enioyed Gods manifold bleſſings in the valley of Achor, did reioyce before the Lord, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed their ioy by ſinging his praiſes: ſo the true Iſrael of God, in the time of the Goſpell, after they are deliuered out of the ſpirituall bondage of ſin and Satan, and are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of all Gods manifold bleſſings, both ſpirituall and temporall, being filled, not onely with ioy, but alſo with
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:10737:137"/> thankfulnes, hauing nothing elſe to returne to the Lord for all his benefits, they burſt foorth into praiſes and thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings.</p>
               <p>The time or place when the Church ſhall performe this dutie, is expreſſed in this word, <hi>there:</hi> whereby is ſignified, that they ſhall thus reioyce and praiſe God in the valley of <hi>Achor,</hi> whileſt they were in the vineyards, which God had giuen them. Where hee alludeth to the cuſtome of grape-gathers in ancient time, who whileſt they gathered their grapes and trode in the Wine-preſſe, ſang praiſes vnto God; vnto which cuſtome the Prophet alludeth, Eſa. 16. 10. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 16. 10.</note> is ſignified, that great ſhould be the Churches alacritie in praiſing God, ſo as ſhe ſhould not defer this dutie, or ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully goe about it, but euen in the fruition of Gods benefits ſhe ſhall be ſo filled with ioy and comfort, that not being able to containe her ſelfe, ſhe ſhall preſently burſt foorth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his praiſes; and that not after a vulgar manner, as thoſe who haue receiued ordinarie benefits, but like vnto thoſe who are raiſed from death to life, from ſorrow and miſerie to all ioy and happineſſe.</p>
               <p>And ſo much for the meaning of the words. The doctrines <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The Do∣ctrines. </seg>
                  </label> hence to be obſerued are theſe. Firſt, here wee learne, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord hath allured vs and ſpoken vnto our hearts by <note place="margin">We muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after true conuerſion, if we would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.</note> his word and Spirit, that is, after that he hath conuerted and brought vs to repentance, and giuen vnto vs inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, peace of conſcience, and ioy in the holy Ghoſt, then doth hee giue vnto vs further aſſurance of his loue, and our reconciliation, by multiplying vpon vs not only corporall but alſo ſpirituall benefits.</p>
               <p>Whence we learne, firſt, that if wee deſire to be made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Gods temporall benefits, we doe aboue all things labour after true conuerſion, and to feele the kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt erected in our hearts, and the inward ioy and comfort of Gods Spirit, and then will the Lord alſo giue vs vineyards and the valley of <hi>Achor,</hi> that is, abundance of his benefits, not only ſufficient for our neceſſarie ſuſtenance, but alſo for our honeſt delight: according to that, Matth. 6. 33. <note place="margin">

                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:10737:138"/> Yea but the faithfull ſometimes want theſe things. I anſwer, if the Lord withdraw temporall benefits, in ſtead of them he beſtoweth more excellent gifts, euen his ſpirituall graces, faith, hope, patience, &amp;c. as appeareth in the example of <hi>Iob.</hi> And though they haue no ſuperfluitie, yet they haue ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie, which they enioy with great comfort and contenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for either the Lord fitteth their ſtate to their mindes, or their mindes to their ſtate; as appeareth in the example of the people of God, fed daily with Manna, and water ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the rocke, of <hi>Elias</hi> fed with Rauens, of the poore widow ſuſtained by her cruiſe of oyle and handfull of meale. Yea and how little ſoeuer the faithfull haue, yet are they bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prouided for then the wicked in the middeſt of all their abundance: for this may faile, bee ſpent, or taken away, but Gods prouidence will neuer faile in prouiding for his, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will the fountaine of his bountie bee euer drie, although it doe not at all times flow alike plentifully and with a full ſtreame: Pſal. 37. 16. 17. <note place="margin">

               <p>And laſtly, from hence we learne, not to expect full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Gods loue and our reconciliation all at once, but <note place="margin">Full aſſurance of Gods loue not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected all at once.</note> by one degree after another: for firſt God allureth vs, and then ſpeaketh comfortably vnto vs by his word and Spirit, aſſuring vs that wee are his children, the which aſſurance is more and more confirmed when he giueth vnto vs the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his children his ſpirituall graces and temporall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we may here obſerue, that howſoeuer the Lord <note place="margin">God mingleth benefits with croſſes.</note> giueth vnto the faithfull plentie of vineyards, &amp; the valley of

But yet wee are not hereby to be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, for the Lord will giue a good iſſue to all our trials, and in the end will grant vnto vs a glorious victorie ouer all our enemies; and changing this valley of trouble into a valley of triumph, will ſo bring vs into full poſſeſſion of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Canaan, where wee ſhall obtaine comfort, without mixture of affliction, ioy without ſorrow, and eternall reſt from the aſſaults of all our enemies.</p>
               <p>When as then wee are in any affliction, let vs remember, that though the Lord for a time ſeeme to frowne vpon vs, yet in the end he will turne vnto vs his gratious countenance, and whileſt wee are in the confines of Gods kingdome the Church militant, let vs patiently beare our croſſe, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that ere long wee ſhall haue full poſſeſſion of our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly Canaan, where we ſhall enioy a perpetuall reſt from all troubles, and be fully repleniſhed with all ioy and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we here learne, that the Lord beſtoweth his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall <note place="margin">Gods tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall benefits are to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful earneſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of thoſe which are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall.</note> benefits corporall and ſpiritual, vpon the faithfull, not only for their preſent vſe and comfort, but alſo for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming and increaſing of their faith and hope, in the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of farre more excellent gifts, euen the vnualuable trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:10737:139"/> of his eternall kingdome; for hee giueth the valley of <hi>Achor</hi> for the doore of hope, that is, the benefits of this life, that they may be pledges and earneſt penies, to aſſure vs of all his benefits belonging to the life to come. The which as it may be vnderſtood of all Gods gifts beſtowed vpon the faithfull, ſo eſpecially of the inward graces of Gods ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit, namely, charitie, zeale, patience, humilitie, loue to the Goſpell, ſanctification of life, and the reſt: ſo that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer finde themſelues indued therewith, they may be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that they haue ſo many pledges and earneſt penies of their eternall happineſſe, and that it is not poſſible that their hope ſhould become void and fruſtrate, which the Lord hath confirmed with ſo many ſeales. The conſideration whereof ſhould make vs to labour aboue all things for theſe ſpiritual gifts and graces, whereby this doore of hope may be opened vnto vs, and wee confirmed in the aſſurance of our election and ſaluation: vnto which dutie the Apoſtle exhorteth vs, 2. Pet. 1. 10. eſpecially let vs by all meanes ſeeke to obtaine <note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10.</note> the gift of Gods Spirit, which giueth vnto vs an aſſured teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie that wee are his children and heires of eternall life, Rom. 8. 16. 17. ſealeth vp this aſſurance in our harts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. 17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 13.</note> Eph. 1. 13. and alſo is the pledge and earneſt penie of our heauenly inheritance, 2. Cor. 1. 22. <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 22. We muſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate vpon Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings new and old, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our thankfulnes.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, whereas the Lord making new promiſes, doth ſhadow them out vnder the allegorie of ancient benefits, to the end that our aſſurance of future bleſſings, by experience of his former goodneſſe and truth, may be ratified and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and that in remembrance of paſted benefits, in the fruition of his preſent bleſſings, and in aſſured hope of his future goodneſſe wee may be ſtirred vp to true thankfulneſſe and obedience: let vs learne hereby, ſeeing we ſtand in need of all theſe helpes, to make this profitable vſe of them, that is, firſt let vs call to minde Gods mercies of old, of which our ſelues haue had experience, as alſo his goodneſſe, truth, and power, which he hath ſhewed towards others, in preſeruing, ſuſtaining and defending them, and ſo ſhall we with greater affiance and confidence depend vpon his neuer failing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:10737:139"/> and all ruling prouidence in the middeſt of all extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. And ſecondly, let vs not only thinke vpon thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, which we preſently enioy, but let them ſerue alſo to call to our remembrance Gods former goodnes towards vs, as alſo thoſe more excellent bleſſings and rich treaſures of his heauenly kingdome, wherof all theſe are but pledges and earneſt penies, that ſo this threefold cable of Gods gratious benefits, being as it were twiſted together in our memories, may more ſtrongly draw vs to true thankfulnes and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that this infinite flame of his loue towards vs, may at leaſt kindle in our hearts ſome ſparks of loue towards him againe.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the doctrines to be obſerued out of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits <note place="margin">Whoſoeuer haue part in ſpirituall bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, are fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led alſo with ioy, gladneſſe and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> here promiſed. Now out of the Churches dutie, wee may further obſerue, that whoſoeuer are made partakers of the former benefits, they are alſo hereby filled with ioy and gladnes, the which they expreſſe by ſinging Gods praiſes, not only with the voice, but alſo with the heart, and by glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying Gods name, not only with verball thankfulnes, but alſo with the fruits of holy obedience, in the whole courſe of their liues: for as certainly as God promiſeth our reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conuerſion, and all other his benefits; ſo doth hee likewiſe promiſe, that thoſe that are poſſeſſed of them, ſhall laud and magnifie his name. And therefore whoſoeuer haue not this inward ioy &amp; gladnes in their harts, nor expreſſe the ſame by lauding and magnifying Gods name, it is certaine they haue no true taſte of Gods ſpirituall benefits. For this inward fire of ioy and thankfulnes will not be ſmothered in the heart, but the flame thereof wil burſt out into praiſes and thankſgiuing. Now becauſe euery one may ſay, that he is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with inward ioy, and may faine and ſtraine out a verball thankfulnes, therefore we muſt labour to approue them by our outward actions, and a continuall courſe of holy obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to be true and ſincere, and ſo they will giue vs aſſurance that we haue indeed our part in al the former benefits; which otherwiſe we cannot haue, ſeeing the Lord giueth the one as well as the other, and to this end beſtoweth his benefits, that
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:10737:140"/> we may glorifie his name by thankfulnes and obedience, as appeareth, 1. Pet. 2. 9. 1. Cor. 6. 20. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. We muſt not deferre our thankfulneſſe.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, we may obſerue, that this our thankfulneſſe is not to be deferred, but preſently to be expreſſed, euen whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt we are in the vineyards, that is, whileſt our hearts are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with ioy, in regard of the comfortable vſe of Gods preſent benefits, and our aſſured hope of thoſe grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mercies in the time to come; for negligent delaies cauſe forgetfulnes, which is alſo the mother of the groſſeſt kinde of vnthankfulnes. But contrariwiſe, then will our praiſes and thankſgiuings be moſt zealous and feruent, when they iſſue from a hart preſently inflamed with the ioyful ſenſe of Gods benefits. An example hereof we haue in <hi>Dauid,</hi> 2. Sam. 7. 18. <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 8. <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 46.</note> in the Iſraelites, Exod. 15. 1. in the Virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> Luk. 1. 46.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we may here obſerue, that as the ioy, ſo the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes <note place="margin">The praiſes of the faithfull muſt not be ſlight, but great and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent. <hi>Eſay</hi> 9. 3.</note> and thankſgiuings of Gods people are not ſlight and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie, but exceeding great and feruent, not only like vnto the ioy in harueſt, that is, in the fruition of Gods common benefits; but like the ioy wherewith men reioyce after ſome famous victory obtained againſt their enemies, yea and ſuch enemies as haue in former times held them in moſt ſeruile and ſlauiſh ſeruitude: for this was the ioy of the Iſraelites, vnto which the Prophet compareth here the ioy and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of the faithfull. Yea in truth, ſo much our ioy and thankfulneſſe ſhould exceed theirs, as the greatnes of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of our ſpirituall deliuerance, out of the miſerable cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie of ſin and Satan, exceedeth the deliuerance of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites out of the bondage of Egypt. We muſt then reioyce and be as thankfull as thoſe ought to bee, who haue paſſed from death to life, from the greateſt miſerie to the higheſt happines, and are exalted from being the firebrands of hell, to be the ſonnes of God and heires of heauen.</p>

               <p>ANd ſo much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the ſecond benefit. In the third place the Lord promiſeth, that he will giue grace to his Church and people, that they ſhall embrace his pure wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:10737:140"/> and ſeruice, and aboliſh all idolatrie and ſuperſtition, in theſe words, Verſ. 16. <hi>And at that day, ſaith the Lord, you</hi>

                  <hi>ſhall call me Iſhi, and ſhall call me no more Baali.</hi> Verſ. 17. <hi>For I will take away the names of Baali out of her mouth, and they ſhall no more be remembred by their names.</hi> In which words the Lord <note place="margin">The expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> promiſeth two things, firſt, that hee will reſtore his ſincere worſhip: ſecondly, that he will roote out all idolatrie. The former, in theſe words, <hi>And at that day, ſaith the Lord, ſhall you call me Iſhi.</hi> Where is ſet downe, firſt, the time when the Church ſhould performe this dutie: and ſecondly, the dutie it ſelfe. The time in theſe words, <hi>And at that day;</hi> that is, when the Lord hath effectually called her, ſpoken comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie vnto her, and multiplied his benefits vpon her, then ſhould ſhe in loue and thankfulnes, ſhew her ſelfe zealous in offering vnto God his pure worſhip, and in aboliſhing all reliques of idolatrie.</p>
               <p>The dutie which the Lord promiſeth ſhe ſhall performe, is, that ſhe ſhall call him <hi>Iſhi,</hi> that is, my husband: where the Lord alludeth to the couenant which is made betweene him and his Church, wherein the Lord promiſeth, that ſhe ſhall be his ſpouſe, and ſhe promiſeth that ſhe will acknowledge the Lord alone to be her husband, and performe all duties of a wife vnto him. As though he ſhould ſay, Howſoeuer in former times thou haſt run after thy louers, yet when I haue called and conuerted thee, thou ſhalt remember the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of mariage betweene vs made, and ſo forſaking thy idols, thou ſhalt acknowledge and profeſſe, that I alone am thy husband. Now whereas he ſaith, that ſhe ſhall call him <hi>Iſhi,</hi> we are firſt hereby to vnderſtand, that the Church mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of her couenant, ſhall embrace him as her only husband, not verbally alone, or with an idle ſhew, but in deed and truth behauing her ſelfe towards him, as it becommeth the Lords ſpouſe, that is, firſt in generall, ſhe ſhall worſhip and ſerue him purely and ſincerely, according to his will; more ſpecially, that ſhe ſhall obſerue coniugall fidelitie, loue him aboue all, depend vpon him alone, with a true affiance for all bleſſings, and call vpon his name: the which dutie is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:10737:141"/> in the text, for it is not ſaid, ſhe ſhall call me husband, but <hi>Iſhi,</hi> O my husband, namely, inuocating his name by prayer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he ſheweth here, that the Church ſhall not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly internally worſhip the Lord, as her only husband in Spirit and truth, but alſo that ſhe ſhall outwardly make profeſſion hereof; which is implied in that he ſaith, ſhee ſhall call him husband, and not onely acknowledge him ſo to bee in her heart and mind.</p>
               <p>And this is the firſt dutie which the Lord promiſeth that the Church ſhall performe. The other is, that as ſhe ſhould be carefull to aduance his pure worſhip, ſo ſhe ſhould ſhew the like zeale in aboliſhing all reliques of idolatrie; ſignified in theſe words, <hi>And thou ſhalt call me no more Baali,</hi> or, <hi>O my Baal;</hi> that is, As I would not haue thee to ioine idols with me in my worſhip, ſo I would not haue thee to worſhip and call vpon me in an idol, or after an idolatrous maner, but in ſpirit and truth, purely &amp; ſincerely. Where the Lord ſheweth, firſt, that the Church ſhall not only worſhip him, but alſo that ſhe ſhould worſhip him alone, and renounce all her idols and falſe gods. Secondly, that ſhe ſhall not worſhip him after an idolatrous manner in images and idols, as it was the manner of the Iſraelites, who worſhipped God in the idoll <hi>Baal,</hi> as appeareth in this place, but ſhall come vnto him immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not by a ſubſtitute or inferiour patron, and call vpon him who is a Spirit ſpiritually, and not in an image.</p>
               <p>But the image of <hi>Baal</hi> being aboliſhed, why would not the Lord be called vpon by the name of <hi>Baal,</hi> ſeeing it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth a god, lord, or patron, and ſometime alſo a husband, as well as <hi>Iſh?</hi> I anſwere, the Lord would be called <hi>Iſh,</hi> rather then <hi>Baal,</hi> firſt, becauſe <hi>Baal</hi> being a name of empire and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, brought with it ſome ſeruile feare; the other name <hi>Iſh</hi> ſignifying properly a husband, offereth nothing to our conſideration but loue, fidelitie, grace and protection; and therefore the Lord refuſeth the former name, in the time of the Goſpell, as being too auſtere, ſauouring only of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and Lordſhip, and will be called by the amiable name of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:10737:141"/> 
                  <hi>Iſh,</hi> or husband, to ſhew that he hath renewed his couenant, is reconciled to his Church, and is now become moſt louing and gratious vnto her.</p>
               <p>The ſecond cauſe, which I take to be the more principall, is, that he might hereby ſhew his deteſtation of idolatrie, in that hee would not endure to bee called by the name of an idoll, though otherwiſe good in it owne ſignification. And this his deteſtation he further ſheweth, when as he ſaith, that they ſhould bee ſo farre from worſhipping idols, or him in them, that they ſhould not ſo much as name them: Verſ. 17. <hi>For I will take away the names of Baali out of her mouth,</hi> &amp;c. <note place="margin">Verſ. 17.</note> Where is ſet downe, who it is that thus purgeth the Church from all the relikes of idolatrie, namely, the Lord himſelfe, <hi>I will take away.</hi> Secondly, the manner or degree, how it muſt be purged, to wit, from all the relikes of idolatrie and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, ſo that it ſhall not be lawfull for the people of God ſo much as to name an idoll, vnleſſe it bee as they name the diuell with hatred and deteſtation. The like places vnto this we haue, Exod. 23. 13. <hi>Ye ſhall make no mention of the name of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 13. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 2. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>other gods, neither ſhall it be heard out of thy mouth.</hi> Deut. 12. 3. <hi>Ye ſhall vtterly deſtroy all the places wherein the nations which ye ſhall poſſeſſe, ſerued their gods vpon the high mountaines,</hi> &amp;c. 3. <hi>Ye ſhall hew downe the grauen images of their gods, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh their names out of that place.</hi> An example whereof wee haue in <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſal. 16. 4. 5. <hi>Their offerings of blood will I not offer, nor make mention of their names with my lips.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 4. 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, hee expreſſeth the end why hee would not haue them ſo much as name idols, to wit, that they may no more be remembred by their names, that is, that hauing nothing to doe with idols, neither in deede nor word, the memorie of them may periſh, and men may be freed from all danger of falling into idolatrie; which being preſerued, there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a continuall baite to intice vs, which in regard of our corruption and proneneſſe to idolatrie, we are apt to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, to our perdition.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of theſe words. The doctrines <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The Do∣ctrines. </seg>
                  </label> which ariſe out of them are theſe. Firſt, out of the 16. verſe
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:10737:142"/> we may obſerue, that as ſoone as we are conuerted and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <note place="margin">Aſſurance of Gods loue makes vs zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in his ſeruice.</note> of Gods loue by the inward teſtimonie of his Spirit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by innumerable his gratious benefits, which are ſo many earneſt penies and pledges of his fauour and our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, then doth the Lord alſo giue vs this grace to ſhew our ſelues forward in the duties of his worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, and in rooting out all ſuperſtition and idolatrie. If ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee be truly conuerted and indued with Gods Spirit, and with the graces thereof, then will we alſo be zealous and deuout in performing ſeruice vnto God, in hearing his word, calling vpon his name, receiuing the Sacraments, &amp;c. as alſo in purging our ſelues from idolatrie and ſuperſtition, and in remouing all falſe meanes of his worſhip: but if this care and zeale be wanting, it is manifeſt, that as yet wee are not conuerted, nor haue taſted of the comfort of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and the graces thereof: for when God hath beſtowed theſe, then at that day alſo he ſtirreth vs vp to loue and ſerue him, as our Lord and husband, forſaking all idols and idoll worſhip, as appeareth in this place.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we may obſerue, that thoſe who are truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted <note place="margin">Thoſe who are truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, openly profeſſe their conuerſion.</note> and indued with Gods Spirit, they doe not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſerue the Lord as their onely husband, but alſo out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly make a confeſſion hereof to the glorie of God and edification of others: for it is not ſaid here that the Church and members thereof ſhould onely in heart acknowledge, but alſo by voice profeſſe, that God was her husband, and forſake and diſclaime with the like open plainneſſe idols and idolatrous worſhip. And ſurely this is a ſingular fruite of our ſaith and vnfained repentance, when as we doe not only ſerue the Lord, and embrace his true religion in our hearts and ſoules, but alſo make an outward profeſſion hereof to all the world, though thereby wee expoſe our ſelues to the ſcoffes and contempt, obloquie and ſlander, malice and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence <note place="margin">

Which holy dutie is commended to Gods ſeruants in many places: Matth. 5. 16. 1. Pet. 2. 12. 3. 15. Rom. 10. 10. An example whereof we haue in <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſal. 22. 22. in the blind man, Ioh. 9. in the Apoſtles,

                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 32.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, wee may obſerue, that the Prophet ſpeaking of <note place="margin">Our ſpirituall mariage com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſeth al con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iugall duties.</note> thoſe duties which the Church being conuerted and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled vnto God ſhould performe vnto him, comprehendeth them all vnder this one, that ſhe ſhould call him husband, becauſe indeede it containeth all the reſt, as being the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine from which they ſpring. For if wee embrace the Lord as our husband, then haue we giuen him both our heart and hand, then haue we plighted vnto him our faith, and then do we alſo loue him aboue all, feare his diſpleaſure, depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his prouidence, and ſhew our ſelues zealous in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming all good duties vnto him. Of which inward graces and outward obedience, whoſoeuer are deſtitute, they are not eſpouſed vnto God, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, wee heere learne, that it is not only vnlawfull to <note place="margin">It is vnlawfull to worſhip God in Idols.</note> worſhip idols, but alſo to worſhip the true God in them. Neither did the Iſraelites worſhip the image of <hi>Baal,</hi> or the falſe god <hi>Baal,</hi> thereby repreſented, but in the idoll they worſhipped the true <hi>Iehoua:</hi> for hee doth not heere forbid them to worſhippe <hi>Baal,</hi> the god of the Sidonians, but that they ſhould call him any more <hi>Baal,</hi> that is, call vpon and worſhip him in the image. So that the Papiſts excuſe, vnder which they maske their idolatrie, is vaine and friuolous: for they ſay that they worſhippe not the images, before which they fall, but God in them: and likewiſe when they worſhip Saints departed, they affirme that they worſhip God in and by them. The which their aſſertion is falſe, as appeareth by their falling downe before them, their making of vowes, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering oblations, and their going on pilgrimage vnto them: and though it were true, that they did not worſhip them, but God in them, yet hereby they are not cleered, ſeeing they commit the ſame idolatrie which God here condemneth in the Iſraelites.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, wee here obſerue, that the Lord is now no more to
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:10737:143"/> be eſteemed of the Church a ſeuere Lord or fearefull Iudge, <note place="margin">The Lord is a gratious huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of the Church.</note> but as a gratious and louing husband. The conſideration whereof ſerueth, firſt to repleniſh our hearts with all ioy and comfort, in that we who were enemies and ſtrangers, are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into ſo neere league of friendſhip, and into ſo inuio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable a bond of loue and amitie with God, as is betweene a moſt louing husband, and his beloued ſpouſe. Secondly, it ſerueth notably for the confirming our ſaith and affiance in God, in the middeſt of all wants, dangers and extremities, in that we haue a husband who is moſt able and readie to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and prouide for vs. Thirdly, it ſerueth to confute the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and practiſe of the Papiſts, who dare not goe directly vnto God by prayer, but by the mediation of Saints: for if Chriſt be eſpouſed vnto vs, to whom may wee preferre our ſuites with greater boldneſſe and confidence, then vnto our gratious husband? or who is more neere vnto vs, then Chriſt, or more deare vnto Chriſt then we, his beloued ſpouſe, that we ſhould make choice of, to be out Mediatour betweene vs and him? And laſtly, here we learne how we ſhould performe our obedience vnto God, not ſeruilely for feare, as vnto a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and ſtraight maſter, but with loue and reuerence, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a gratious husband, whoſe will wee performe, rather to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid thereby his diſpleaſure, then for any hope of gaine, or feare of puniſhment.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the doctrines to be obſerued out of the 16. <note place="margin">The Lord purgeth his Church from all idolatrie and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> verſe. Out of the 17. verſe wee may further obſerue, who it is that purgeth the Church from all idolatrie and ſuperſtition, and reſtoreth Gods true and ſincere worſhippe and ſeruice, namely, the Lord himſelfe, <hi>I will take away;</hi> So that it is not in the will and purpoſe, nor in the power and policie of man, to worke this great alteration and reformation firſt and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally; for man in his owne nature is prone to idolatrie and ſuperſtition, and when he is once entred into it, in ſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning out of this puddle, he is readie, being ouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhooes, to plunge himſelfe ouer head and eares; but it is the Lord himſelfe, who illuminateth our eyes with the knowledge of his truth, and inableth vs to diſcerne the ſottiſhnes of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:10737:143"/> and the filthines of our ſpirituall whoredomes, and moueth our harts to loath and deteſt them, &amp; to embrace his true religion and ſincere worſhip. And therfore, when as we would haue the houſe of God clearely purged from all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of ſuperſtitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we muſt not only euery man in his place and calling, further as much as in vs lieth this good worke, but principally wee are all in generall to ioyne together in prayer vnto God, deſiring his aſſiſtance for the effecting of it, for he is the chiefe cauſe thereof, and the greateſt Potentates of the earth are in this worke but his inſtruments and depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whom he can eaſilie incline to effect it, when ſo it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him: Prou. 21. 1. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 21. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, we may obſerue, that there cannot too great <note place="margin">There cannot too great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence be vſed in purging the Church from idolatrie.</note> preciſeneſſe, care and diligence bee vſed, in purging the Church from all reliques of idolatrie and ſuperſtition, and in reſtoring the puritie of religion and Gods true worſhip, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preſcript rule of his Word; as appeareth in this place, where the Lord refuſeth to be called by the name of <hi>Baal,</hi> though good in it owne ſignification, becauſe it had been abuſed to idolatrie, and enioyneth his people not ſo much as to mention the name of an idoll. The like places are thoſe before quoted, Exod. 23. 13. Deut. 12. 2. 3. Pſal. 16. 4. 5. to which we may adde Zach. 13. 2. <hi>I wil cut off the names</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>of the Idols out of the land, and they ſhall no more be remembred:</hi> and Eſay 30. 22. <hi>Yee ſhall pollute the couering of the images of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſay</hi> 30. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>ſiluer, and the rich ornament of the images of gold, and cast them away as a menstruous cloth, and you ſhall ſay vnto it, get thee hence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This rule then is to be obſerued of all, who reforme the <note place="margin">Idolatrie muſt be rooted out, both head and taile.</note> Church, that they root out idolatrie and ſuperſtition, both head and taile, in ſubſtance and ceremonie, and not ſuffer an idolatrous or ſuperſtitious name to remaine: yea they are not only to remoue things out of the Church, which are ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous and ſuperſtitious in their owne nature, but alſo ſuch indifferent things, as being lawfull in themſelues are abuſed to idolatrie; becauſe through the corruption of our nature,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:10737:144"/> all meanes and occaſions, to put vs in mind of idolatrie, are ſo many traps to catch vs, and ſo many baites to allure vs to fall into this ſin againe. So heere the Lord will not haue his people to name <hi>Baalims,</hi> becauſe he would not haue them ſo much as remembred. But leſt it might be obiected, that theſe idolatrous names are originally euill, wee ſhall alſo finde, Ier. 23. 36. that the Lord forbiddeth to call his Word, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jerem.</hi> 23. 36.</note> the burthen of the Lord, notwithſtanding that it was his owne phraſe by the mouth of his Prophets, becauſe it was now growne amongſt the people into obloquie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. And <hi>Ezechias</hi> is commended for breaking the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen ſerpent, which was made by Gods appointment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the people abuſed it to idolatrie, 2. King. 18. 4. Yea but <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 18. 4. Princes and ſupreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates muſt reforme the Church.</note> who hath this authoritie to purge the Church from all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of idolatrie? I anſwere, chiefe Gouernours, Princes, and ſupreme Magiſtrates, who are appointed by God to be the nurſing fathers of the Church; neither may priuate men intermeddle with publike reformation, but only the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Church, as we may ſee it confirmed by innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable preſidents in Gods word. And they, as I ſaid, are to root out idolatrie and all reliques thereof; for this is a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar dutie belonging vnto them, which is ſo much commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in thoſe godly Magiſtrates and Kings, <hi>Moſes, Dauid, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechias, Ioſias,</hi> and the reſt: the neglect whereof, wee ſhall find condemned in other Kings, though vertuous and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, who reſtoring Gods true religion, yet ſuffered the groues and high places to remaine.</p>
               <p>But if this dutie be neglected by Magiſtrates, how are pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate <note place="margin">Priuate men muſt not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle with publike reformation.</note> men to behaue themſelues? I anſwere, they muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their courſes within the compaſſe of their calling, and in the firſt place they muſt ſeeke to reforme themſelues, and thoſe vnder their priuate charge, purging &amp; preſeruing them as from all other ſinnes, ſo eſpecially from all manner of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie and ſuperſtition; and for the publike reformation they are to further it, as priuate men, by petition, the helpe of their friends, and beſt meanes, eſpecially they are to commend
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:10737:144"/> Gods cauſe into his owne hands, by feruent and continuall praier, who is able to bring it to paſſe, by iuſt and lawfull courſes.</p>
               <p>But may they ioyne themſelues to ſuch Churches as are <note place="margin">Ceremoniall imperfections of the Church muſt not cauſe a ſeparation.</note> ſpotted with imperfections? I anſwere, there are ſome cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions which are ſubſtantiall and vndermine the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of religion, and theſe may iuſtly cauſe a ſeparation: but there are others in ceremonies and circumſtances onely, the ſubſtance and parts of religion and Gods worſhip remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſound and vnſhaken; and theſe are not cauſes ſufficient to make a rent from the Church, ſeeing there was neuer any Church without her wants and imperfections: and ſeeing where the foundation remaineth ſure (as it doth where the Word is purely and ſincerely taught, and the Sacraments ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred according to Chriſts inſtitution) there we may bee built vp in Chriſt, and attaine vnto eternall ſaluation.</p>
               <p>And as the people are not for theſe wants and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to leaue the publike ſeruice of God, ſo neither (as I take it) are Gods Miniſters to forſake their miniſtrie, without the helpe whereof, the people cannot publikely worſhip God, nor be built vp in Chriſt, and edified in their holy faith, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they will vndergoe ſome rites and ceremonies, though very inconuenient, if it cannot be proued that they are in their vſe ſimplie euill and vnlawfull: Neither do I thinke any inconuenience ſo great, as the neglect of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Chriſt crucified, &amp;c. 1. Cor. 9. 16. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 16. The prophane practiſe of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas God ſaith, that his people ſhall not ſo much as name idols, vnleſſe it be with hatred and deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, here is condemned the prophane practiſe of our Poets, who thinke their poems are not artificiall, and in the right poeticall vaine, vnleſſe they bee ſtuffed with the names of Heathen idols, as <hi>Iupiter, Apollo, Pallas, Venus, Cupid,</hi> and ſuch like; ſometime alſo in a prophane deuotion, inuocating their helpe, for the perfecting of their poeſie: but accurſed be that vaine, wit, or eloquence which ſacrilegiouſly robbeth God of his honor, &amp; beſtoweth it vpon idols, whether it be done in ieſt or earneſt. So likewiſe here is condemned their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:10737:145"/> who ſweare by the idoll of the Maſſe, by the Rhood, and ſuch like idols; for what is this but to renue their credit by an honorable remembrance of them, and after an idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous manner to ſeate them in Gods place, which we are not ſo much as to name, without branding them with ſome note of hatred and deteſtation?</p>

The firſt is expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>I will make in that day a couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for them with the wilde beasts.</hi> Where the Lord ſheweth, that when his people were conuerted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled vnto him, he would not only beſtow vpon them his benefits both ſpirituall and corporall, but alſo defend them from dangers, ſo that no euill ſhould come vnto them: and particularly, he promiſeth to protect them from vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures, which are all referred to three ſorts: firſt beaſts, as Beares, Lions, Tigres, Wolues, &amp;c. ſecondly, the fowles of heauen, by which hee vnderſtandeth all rauenous and harmefull birds; thirdly creeping things, as ſerpents, canker wormes, locuſts, caterpillers, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>All which creatures before the fall were by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment vnder mans lordſhip and dominion, yeelding vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him voluntarie and free obedience, but after by his ſinne
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:10737:145"/> and rebellion, man had made God his enemie, he loſt his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigntie, the creatures rebelling againſt him, who was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell to their great Lord and Creator, and pulling their necks out of the yoke of their ſubiection; and whereas before they peaceably obeyed him, now they were willing to bee the Lords readie inſtruments to inflict deſerued puniſhments, and bring man to deſtruction; the water to drowne him, as it did the whole world; the fire to burne him, as it did Sodome; the aire to poyſon and infect him, as in the time of the peſtilence; the earth to ſwallow him, as it did <hi>Dathan</hi> and his followers; the beares to deuoure him, as <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 17. 25. <hi>Numb.</hi> 21. 6.</note> they did the 42. children at the prayer of <hi>Eliſha;</hi> the lions to deſtroy him, as they did the Samaritanes; Serpents to ſting him, as they did the Iſraelites; yea euen the baſeſt creatures haue both will &amp; power enough when God giueth ſigne of battel, as frogs, caterpillers, lice, as we may ſee in the plagues of Egypt, and in the example of <hi>Herod</hi> deuoured by lice. <note place="margin">

               <p>And therefore when the Lord muſtereth and marſhalleth vp together his armie of iudgements, wherewith he puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the rebellion and ſin of man, cruell and noiſome beaſts are one choice band wherewith he aſſaulteth him, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Leuit. 26. 22.

               </p>
               <p>But it may be demanded how this promiſe is accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, <note place="margin">How y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful haue peace with the brute creatures.</note> ſeeing the godly man hath theſe beaſts in ſubiection no more then the wicked, and oftentimes they are alike hurtfull
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:10737:146"/> and pernitious vnto both. I anſwere, firſt, that the Lord doth performe this promiſe as hee doth all other concerning worldly and temporall benefits and deliuerances, namely, not abſolutely, but conditionally, ſo farre foorth as they will ſtand with his glorie and the good and ſaluation of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: and if at any time it fall out otherwiſe, then though he inflicteth vpon them the contrarie afflictions, troubles and dangers, yet hee ſanctifieth them for the accompliſhing of theſe maine ends, the furthering of his owne glorie and their ſaluation, ſo as they are not hurtful, but exceeding good and profitable vnto them. And thus the Lord performeth his promiſe of preſeruing his children from bruite beaſts and ſuch like dangers, ſo that either they may be aſſured of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance from them, which vſually the Lord granteth, as wee may ſee in the example of <hi>Daniel</hi> in the lions denne, and <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. <hi>Act.</hi> 28. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul</hi> whom the viper could not hurt; or otherwiſe if they be ouertaken of theſe dangers it is for their good, ſeeing all things, euen afflictions themſelues, worke together for the beſt to Gods elect, Rom. 8. 28. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, wee are to know, that the Lord doth vſually in the old Teſtament, vnder the promiſes of temporall benefits and deliuerances, with which the people were beſt acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſhadow out vnto them his ſpirituall grace and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and ſo here particularly he promiſeth protection and deliuerance from brute and ſauage beaſts, with which the Iſraelites were much vexed and indangered, that by this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit which they could feelingly apprehend, he might leade them as it were by the hand, and bring them to a full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of his protection and carefull prouidence, alwaies watching ouer them for their deliuerance out of all dangers, eſpecially from the furie and malice of our ſpirituall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, ſinne, Satan, and the world, who neuer ceaſe aſſaulting of Gods elect. 1. Pet. 5. 8. <note place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, this couenant of peace and harmeleſneſſe may be ſaid to be made betweene all creatures and Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, becauſe after they are reconciled vnto God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his ſonnes by adoption and grace, then is their ancient
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:10737:146"/> title and right of dominion and rule ouer all the creatures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, which was loſt by the fall; into the poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of which right they enter in this life, but enioy it not in full perfection vntill y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> life to come; for the ſubiection of the creatures vnto vs dependeth vpon our ſubiection and obedience to God, and therefore becauſe this is but begun and imperfect in this life, theirs alſo to vs is imperfect and but in part.</p>
               <p>And this is the firſt part of our peace and ſecuritie, which reſpecteth the brute creatures. Now becauſe there is no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter enemie to man then man, according to the prouerbe, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo homini lupus,</hi> therefore the Lord likewiſe promiſeth his Church peace and ſecuritie, in reſpect of thoſe manifold dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which men might cauſe vnto them; <hi>And I will breake the bow and the ſword,</hi> &amp;c. Where vnder theſe inſtruments of warre, the ſword and bow, we are to vnderſtand warre it ſelfe; as though hee ſhould ſay, I will not onely make peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene my Church and the brute creatures, but alſo between men themſelues, ſo that all warre, hatred and contention ſhal ceaſe, and floriſhing peace and tranquillitie ſhall be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed vpon the earth. The like places vnto this wee haue, Eſa. 2. 4. and 11. 6. 7. 8. 9. and 32. 17. 18. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 2 4 <hi>&amp;</hi> 11. 6. 7. 32. 17. 18. How God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth the couenant of peace vnto the Church.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Yea but the Church is not freed from warres, nay rather as ſoone as we profeſſe our ſelues Gods ſeruants, we are ſure to haue the world to bee our enemie, who bendeth all her force againſt Gods Saints, and laboureth both by ſecret trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and by open force to bring them to deſtruction. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, our Sauiour hath taught vs, that he came not to bring <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 34.</note> peace but warre, euen betweene neereſt friends; and that in theſe latter times we are eſpecially to expect warres, vprores, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentions; how therfore is this promiſe accompliſhed? I anſwere, it is performed either in reſpect of an outward and worldly, or an inward and ſpirituall peace. If wee vnderſtand it in the firſt ſenſe, then this promiſe of a worldly peace (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a temporarie benefit) is to be vnderſtood with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and limitation before prefixed, namely, of Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and our ſpirituall good.</p>
               <p>Secondly, God thus performeth his promiſe, not by free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:10737:147"/> them altogether from warres, but by defending and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuering them in the day of battaile, ſo as the force and furie of their enemies ſhall not hurt them: and this is ſignified by the phraſe here vſed, for hee doth not ſay that hee will take cleane away the bow, ſword, and battaile, but that hee will breake them, that is, weaken, abate, and ouerrule their force and power, ſo as they who depend vpon him ſhall not bee deſtroyed by them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this promiſe is accompliſhed among the faithfull themſelues, which howſoeuer before their conuerſion they are one to another as cruel and hurtful as lions, tigers, beares, yet after they ioyne themſelues to Gods Church, they lay aſide their malice and brutiſh nature, and performe all mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall duties of loue &amp; Chriſtian amitie, as appeareth Eſa. 11. 6. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 11. 6. The ſpirituall peace of the faithfull.</note> But eſpecially vnder the type of this outward peace, wee are to vnderſtand that Euangelicall and ſpirituall peace, which is inwardly ſeated in the heart and conſcience, after that we are aſſured of our reconciliation with God through Ieſus Chriſt, which the Angel firſt proclaimed, Luk. 2. 14. and our Sauiour afterwards promiſed to all the faithfull, who are truly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 14.</note> and haue ſubiected themſelues to beare his yoke of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obedience, Matth. 11. 29. of which the Apoſtle alſo ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, <note place="margin">

So that howſoeuer in the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 22.</note> creation, all the creatures were made for man, ſubiected vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his gouernment, and appointed for his vſe, and man only was made for God and his ſeruice; yet after man by his fall had diſabled himſelf, ſo as he neither could nor would ſerue his Creator, the creatures were freed from the ſubiection and ſlauiſh vſe of man; and in ſtead of ſeruing and obeying him, they are readie euery one in their place, to be the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners of Gods iuſt iudgements, inflicted for his ſinne and rebellion: like ſeruants who ſet themſelues againſt their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, when he traiterouſly ſetteth himſelfe againſt his Prince, who is the chiefe Lord and Soueraigne ouer them all. When as therefore we heare of loſſes and ſpoiles by fire or water, of the hurt or death of men by the brute beaſts, and ſerpents, of dearth and ſcarcitie cauſed by too much raine or drought, cankers, caterpillers and ſuch like, all and euery of theſe are ſo many remembrancers to put vs in mind of our ſinnes and rebellion againſt God, and ſo many monitors to warne vs, that we forſake our wicked courſes, and turne to the Lord by vnfained repentance.</p>

               <p>Thirdly, wee may here learne, what is the beſt meanes to <note place="margin">The beſt meanes of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a well grounded peace with men.</note> obtaine and enioy a ſound and well grounded peace with men, or at leaſt entertaine a iuſt and ſafe warre, namely, by turning from our ſinnes, and ſeeking earneſtly reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God in Chriſt; for the cauſe of inward rebellions, and outward inuaſions, is our ſins, which prouoke the Lord
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:10737:149"/> to iuſt diſpleaſure, and moue him to raiſe vp againſt vs, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at home and broad, to the end they may execute his iuſt iudgements againſt vs. The way therfore to ſettle peace, and preuent warre, is to take away this cauſe, to wit, our ſins by true repentance, and to labour that we may be at peace with God, and then he will giue vs peace with men, or at leaſt a proſperous warre, wherin he will aſſiſt and protect vs againſt our enemies. Whereby it appeareth, that that peace which is grounded vpon worldly policies, and hath not this peace with God for the foundation thereof, howſoeuer it may laſt for a time, yet in the end it will proue rotten and vnſound. For example, ſome thinke it the beſt courſe to ſettle a peace by tolerating Poperie and idolatrie, ſome by vtter forſaking Gods true religion, and by conforming our ſelues to the world, both in profeſſion and life; ſome by ioyning in neere leagues with neighbour Princes, and by many ſuch other deuices: but ſeeing the Word plainly teacheth vs, that the only ſure foundation of our peace, is our reconciliation with God, and holy obedience to his Commandements; how can wee hope to obtaine it by taking ſuch courſes, as will cauſe the Lord to be our enemie, and by tranſgreſſing his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, the breach whereof the Lord threatneth in ſo many places to puniſh with warre, and thoſe innumerable miſeries which do accompanie it? So Leuit. 26. 25. Deut. 28. <note place="margin">

               <p>The vſe which we are to make hereof, is, that when wee heare of our enemies preparations, we do in the firſt place conſider, that our ſinnes is the cauſe of this warre intended againſt vs; and therefore before we reſolue vpon any other courſe for our defence, let vs repent of our ſinnes, and labour to be at peace with God, and ſo he will change their minds, or vſe their malice for their owne deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we may here obſerue, what is the chiefe cauſe of <note place="margin">The Lord is the chiefe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of our peace.</note> our peace and tranquillitie, namely, not our owne power and policie, or ſtrength of neere adioyning friends, but the Lord himſelfe; and therefore when we do enioy it, as wee haue done for many yeares, let vs aſcribe the whole praiſe
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:10737:149"/> and glorie vnto God who is the author thereof: and let vs <note place="margin">

               <p>Laſtly, we may here obſerue a notable marke of thoſe that <note place="margin">Chriſtian ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie a true note of our conuerſion.</note> are truly conuerted vnto God, &amp; reconciled in Chriſt, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when as with a Chriſtian ſecuritie we can reſt vpon Gods prouidence and protection, after we haue attained vnto ſome aſſurance of the pardon of our ſinnes, not onely when the world promiſeth ſafetie, but alſo in the middeſt of troubles and dangers: for there is no ſuch peace to the wicked, who <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 57. 21.</note> howſoeuer they are bold and confident in their proſperitie, yet when they are ouertaken with any vnexpected danger, faint with feare, and are perplexed with a guiltie aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; whereas they who are at peace with God haue the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace of a good conſcience, which maketh them (as the Wiſe man ſaith) confident as a lion, knowing that Gods <note place="margin">

               <p>Seeing therefore this vnion betweene Chriſt and vs, is in <note place="margin">The great ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene our ſpiritual vnion with Chriſt and mariage.</note> ſo many places reſembled to mariage, let vs in the next place conſider the great ſimilitude which is betwixt them, that ſo wee may the more plainly conceiue of this excellent myſterie, which is the ground and foundation of al our good and happineſſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, as vnto euery lawfull mariage, there is required that the parties married be of the ſame kinde and nature, ſo it is in this ſpirituall mariage; for the Sonne of God the ſecond perſon in Trinitie tooke vpon him our nature and was made fleſh, that ſo he might be a fit husband of the Church; and the Church is regenerate and purged from her ſinnes and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 1.</note> of nature, that ſo being made like Chriſt in holines and vnblame ableneſſe, ſhe might become a fit ſpouſe for Chriſt: as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, Epheſ. 5. 25. 26. 27. So that if <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ</hi> 5. 25. 27</note> we ſpeake properly, neither God the Father, nor God the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoſt is the husband of the Church, but God the Sonne, who alone tooke vpon him our nature, and became like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs: and therfore both this and all the like places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which ſpeake of the mariage between the Lord and the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:10737:150"/> Church, are to be vnderſtood properly of God the Sonne.</p>
               <p>And as theſe perſons being of the ſame nature ought to be of a different ſex male and female: ſo in this ſpirituall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage Chriſt is the man or husband, the Church is the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or ſpouſe; who was taken out of the ſide of Chriſt in his deadly ſleepe, as <hi>Eua</hi> out of <hi>Adams,</hi> and therefore may bee ſaid to be bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh, of whom he begetteth by the ſeede of his word and holy Spirit many faithfull children vnto himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as in mariages there ought to be only two ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, one man with one woman, according to that Matth. 19. 5. <hi>And they two ſhall be one fleſh:</hi> ſo in this ſpirituall <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 5.</note> marriage there are but two, one husband, Chriſt, and one ſpouſe, the Church: for although the faithfull are many in number, yet they make but one intire bodie, ſeeing they are conioyned and quickned by the ſame Spirit, as diuers mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers make but one bodie, being quickened by the ſame ſoule.</p>
               <p>And as in our ordinarie mariages ſpeciall regard is to bee had, that we be not vnequally yoked, the godly with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, the beleeuer with the infidell, as the Apoſtle chargeth vs, 2. Cor. 6. 14. So in this ſpirituall mariage, Chriſt the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, moſt iuſt &amp; holie, hath had a ſpeciall care not to chuſe, <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14.</note> but to make his ſpouſe, being choſen, glorious, and without any ſpot or wrinkle, holie and vnblameable, by waſhing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 26. 27.</note> her ſinnes and corruptions with his blood, and that firſt in her iuſtification, whereby her ſinnes are pardoned, and hid out of Gods ſight, with the rich robe of Chriſts righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and ſecondly by ſanctification, whereby ſhe is freed from the power, dominion, and corruption of ſinne it ſelfe, and made pure and holy; the which worke is begun in this life, and finiſhed in the life to come.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore all who are married vnto Chriſt are alſo iuſtified and ſanctified, hence it followeth, that thoſe in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinne not only liueth but alſo raigneth, are not eſpouſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt: for hee who requireth at our hands that wee be
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:10737:151"/> not vnequally yoked, will much leſſe match himſelfe thus vnequally.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as in all mariages there is required a double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, firſt of the parents, and ſecondly of the parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: ſo in this ſpirituall mariage, there is firſt the conſent of God the Father, who hath giuen the Church to Chriſt, that he might redeeme and ſaue it; and Chriſt likewiſe vnto the Church, that he might be the head and husband thereof: the which his conſent and free good will, in this mutuall dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he hath made knowne vnto vs in the Goſpell, and doth more and more confirme vs in the aſſurance thereof by the Sacraments of Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper. So likewiſe there is a mutuall conſent betweene the parties: for firſt our Sauiour Chriſt took our nature vpon him, and was made like vnto vs in all things, ſinne only excepted, that hee might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our husband, head and Sauiour: and this his ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable good will hee hath made knowne vnto his ſpouſe, in that he was content for her ſake not only to abaſe himſelfe, by taking vpon him the forme of a ſeruant, but alſo therein to ſuffer ſo many miſeries, ignominie, reproch, whippings, buffetings, reuilings, crowning with thornes, and death it ſelfe, yea the curſed death of the croſſe, and the anger of God more bitter then all the reſt, that hereby he might purge his Church from all her ſinnes, adorne her with his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſo make her a fit ſpoule for ſuch an husband.</p>
               <p>So the Church alſo giues her conſent to this ſpirituall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, when as ſhe acknowledgeth Chriſt alone for her Lord and husband, and reſteth &amp; relieth vpon him only, by a true and liuely faith for her prouiſion of al neceſſaries, protection from all dangers, and for eternall happineſſe and ſaluation; and when alſo ſhe endeuoureth to approoue her ſelfe the ſpouſe of Chriſt by her holy obedience and ſubiection vnto his will.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, as in mariage there is not only a verball or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginarie coniunction, but alſo a reall and ſubſtantiall vnion, not of the bodie alone, but alſo of their hearts and mindes, ſo
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:10737:151"/> as they are no more two but one fleſh: ſo in the mariage of Chriſt and his Church, the vnion betweene them is reall and ſubſtantiall, and that in reſpect of their whole perſon, bodie with bodie, and ſoule with ſoule; neither is the Church vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto Chriſts humanitie alone, but to the whole perſon God and man, for ſuch is the inſeparable vnion betweene the two natures of Chriſt, that they who are conioyned with the one, are knit to the other likewiſe. So Ioh. 6. 56. Epheſ. 5. 30. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 56. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 30. 1. <hi>Cor</hi> 10. 16. 17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. 17.</note> 1. Cor. 10. 16. 17. &amp; 6. 17.</p>
               <p>But firſt of all, the vnion beginneth betweene the Church and Chriſts humane nature, and then by meanes hereof, it is vnited to the diuine nature likewiſe; for ſeeing there was no proportion betweene vs and God, becauſe he was infinite, and we finite, therefore there could be no vnion, but by our mediator Ieſus Chriſt God and man; but being vnited vnto the manhood of Chriſt, wee are hereby alſo vnited to his Godhead: neither can diſtance of place hinder this reall and ſubſtantiall vnion, ſeeing it is ſpirituall, the chiefe bond of this vnion being the holy Ghoſt, who filleth all places; and ſeeing in an earthly mariage, diſtance of place cannot fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate or take away the vnion which is betweene man and wife, much leſſe can it breake off this heauenly and ſpirituall vnion betweene Chriſt and his Church.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, as there are diuers ſpeciall ends of the mariage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <note place="margin">The ends of our ſpirituall marriage.</note> man and wife: as 1. For their mutual good and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, man being the head and guide of his wife, and the wife being a helper to her husband: 2. For the auoiding of forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: 3. For generation of children: So likewiſe our ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall mariage with Chriſt hath the ſame ends. For it is inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God: firſt, for their mutuall good, namely, for the good of Chriſt, becauſe it is good for the husband to bee with his ſpouſe, it is profitable for the head to bee ioyned with the members, it is for the glorie of a King to bee neere his ſubiects, it tendeth to the perfection of the foundation, to be ioyned with the reſt of the building: it is good alſo for the Church to be ioyned in mariage with Chriſt, becauſe in him ſhe hath all her good, the pardon of her ſinnes, reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:10737:152"/> with God, ſanctification, and eternall life and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the auoiding of ſpirituall whoredome, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we vnderſtand it ſpecially of idolatrie, or generally of all other ſinnes, wherewith we defile both bodie and ſoule; the which end reſpecteth not Chriſt our husband, who is pure and free from all ſinne, but the ſpouſe, who being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inclined co commit ſpirituall whoredome with ſinne and Satan, is reſtrained by vertue of this ſpirituall vnion with Chriſt; whereby being made partaker of Gods Spirit, theſe her luſts and concupiſcences, are mortified and ſubdued, and ſhe contrariwiſe is inclined to keepe her ſelfe vnſpotted and vndefiled, and to performe holy obedience to Chriſt her husband.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this ſpirituall mariage was inſtituted, that Chriſt of the Church might beget a holy ſeed, by his word and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, euen euery faithfull man, and all the particular members of this bodie. For theſe in diuers reſpects, may be called both the ſpouſe and children of Chriſt: his ſpouſe as they are ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto him by a liuely faith in mariage; his children as they are begotten vnto him of the Church, by his word and Spirit.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, as betweene maried perſons, many duties are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually <note place="margin">Duties to be performed in our ſpirituall marriage.</note> to be performed, ſome wherof are commune to both, and ſome proper to either partie; ſo the like duties are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Chriſt and his Church. The commune duties are principally coniugall loue, faithfulnes, cohabitation, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of perſons and goods; all which on Chriſts part are performed in the higheſt degree of perfection: for firſt, he hath ſufficiently manifeſted his loue to his Church, in that he was content to giue his life for her redemption, Epheſ. 5. 25. Secondly, he is ſo faithfull in keeping his couenant with <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 25.</note> her, that her vnfaithfulnes and infidelitie cannot make his promiſe vaine, and his faith of none effect, Rom. 3. 3. 4. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he dwelleth with her euen to the end of the world, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 3. 4.</note> her by his power, and guiding her by his word and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Matth. 28. 20. Ioh. 14. 16. Fourthly, he communicateth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 16.</note>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:10737:152"/> his perſon with vs, and all his goods and benefits; ſo that he is now become ours, and all that belongeth vnto him: his merits are our merits, his ſatisfaction our ſatisfaction, his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience our obedience, his righteouſnes our righteouſnes, his holines our holines, his wiſdome our wiſdome, his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome our kingdome. And ſo likewiſe theſe commune du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are performed by his ſpouſe the Church, in her meaſure and proportion; for ſhe loueth her husband Chriſt, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth her heart and affections vpon him, ſo as ſhe can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for his ſake to forſake the world, yea euen her own ſelfe. She deſireth to keepe her mariage faith, abhorring all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall whoredome, and labouring to reſerue her ſelfe for her husband holy and vndefiled; ſhee dwelleth with him, and rangeth not abroad into the world, but keepeth her ſelfe within her bounds and limits; ſhe communicateth her ſelfe, and what ſhe hath vnto him, and hauing nothing elſe worth the gift, ſhe giueth him her heart, praiſing and rendring vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him all poſſible laud and thankes for all his benefits, and offering vnto him with a ſincere heart his pure worſhip and ſeruice, by whoſe treaſures alone ſhe is inriched.</p>
               <p>The ſame ſimilitude is betweene their ſpeciall duties, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing <note place="margin">Special duties betweene Chriſt and his Church. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7.</note> peculiarly to either partie: for as the husband being the head, is to rule and gouerne his wife, to inſtruct her as a man of knowledge, to direct and counſell her, to protect and defend her, to cheriſh her as his owne fleſh; to prouide ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his power all things neceſſarie for her, and to to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate and beare with her infirmities, as being the weaker veſſell; So doth Chriſt Ieſus behaue himſelfe to his ſpouſe the Church: for he gouerneth, inſtructeth, counſelleth, and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth her by his word and Spirit; he protecteth her by his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie power from all dangers, and the furie and malice of all her enemies; he prouideth for her by his alſufficient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, he cheriſheth and nouriſheth her as his owne fleſh, yea with his owne fleſh and precious blood vnto euerlaſting <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 25.</note> life: and though ſhe be full of infirmities and imperfections, he beareth with her as being the weaker veſſell: for as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>He knoweth whereof ſhee is made, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth</hi>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:10737:153"/> 
                  <hi>that ſhee is but dust,</hi> Pſalm. 103. 14. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 14.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo likewiſe as the wife ſubiecteth her ſelfe to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, as to her head and gouernour, obeying him in all things which are honeſt and lawfull, as ſhee regardeth him with reuerent reſpect, and ingenuouſly feareth his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and in a word, as ſhee demeaneth her ſelfe in all her words and actions, modeſtly, ſoberly, humblie and quietly, ſo as ſhe may be moſt amiable to her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: So the Church ſubmitteth her ſelfe vnto Chriſt, as vnto her only Lord and husband, ſhe performeth vnto him abſolute obedience, ſhe reuerenceth him with awfull loue, and feareth his diſpleaſure aboue all worldly loſſe; and to conclude, in all her carriage and conuerſation, ſhe demeaneth her ſelfe humblie and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, deſiring nothing more then to appeare louely and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable in Chriſts ſight.</p>
               <p>But yet in the degree and meaſure of performing theſe mutuall duties, there is to be obſerued a difference; for Chriſt performeth them all moſt abſolutely, and in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of all perfection. The Church performeth them alſo, but yet in her meaſure and proportion: that part of the Church indeed which is triumphat, performeth theſe duties to her husband Chriſt, in ſuch a degree of perfection, as the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is capable of, yet far ſhort of that meaſure and degree, in which her husband performeth them: but the Church mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant with much more weakneſſe and imperfection, for wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſhe is partly regenerate, and partly vnregenerate, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall part laboureth to performe all good duties vnto Chriſt, but the fleſh rebelleth and diſobeyeth, ſhe delighteth to obey her husband in the inner man, but ſhe findeth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther law in her members rebelling againſt the law of her <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom</hi> 7. 22. 23.</note> minde, which oftentimes leadeth her captiue to the law of ſinne, whereby it commeth to paſſe that all the duties which ſhe performeth, are ſo mingled with corruptions, and ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with imperfections, that were not her husband Chriſt infinite in mercie and compaſſion, they would rather deſerue his hatred then his loue, and puniſhment rather then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: but ſuch is his abundant goodnes towards his ſpouſe,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:10737:153"/> that her imperfect obedience is accepted of him as perfect, he reſpecteth not her deede but her will, and regardeth not her actions but her affection, and ſo that ſhe earneſtly deſire and painfully endeuour in the integritie and vprightneſſe of her heart to performe all duties of loue and obedience vnto him, hee pardoneth her infirmities, and waſheth away the ſtaines and ſpots of her corruptions and imperfections with his owne moſt pretious blood.</p>
               <p>And this is the mariage betweene Chriſt and his Church of which the Prophet here ſpeaketh. Now let vs more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially intreate of the words themſelues, and of thoſe points concerning this ſpirituall mariage contained in them. <hi>And I will marrie thee vnto me for euer,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein are contained two principall points: firſt, the eſpouſals of the Church vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">The author of our ſpirituall mariage.</note> Chriſt: and ſecondly, the adiuncts or properties appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to this happie contract. In the firſt is expreſſed, firſt, the author of this mariage: ſecondly, the act of eſpouſing: third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the parties contracted. The author of this mariage is God himſelfe, and if we ſpeak properly God the Father, who ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his Son in mariage with the Church by his holy Spirit, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> this is not a match of our owne ſeeking, or making, for in our owne natures wee are alienated and eſtranged from God, but God loueth vs firſt before we loue him, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour <note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 19.</note> Chriſt wooeth the Church, and with his gratious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of innumerable bleſſings and benefits he winneth her heart, and moueth her to affect him: Ezech. 16. 8. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16. 8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now the inſtrumentall cauſe or meanes whereby God maketh this mariage, are his Prophets, Apoſtles, and faithfull Miniſters, who are Gods ambaſſadours, whom he ſendeth to perſwade and effect it, as the Apoſtle ſheweth, 2. Cor. 5. 20. <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>Now then are wee ambaſſadours for Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that he had prepared the Corinthians <hi>for one huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, to preſent them as a pure virgin to Chriſt,</hi> 2. Cor. 11. 2. <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the act of eſpouſing is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained in theſe words: <note place="margin">The act of eſpouſing.</note> 
                  <hi>I will eſpouſe thee.</hi> Whereby it appeareth, that howſoeuer the Prophet vttereth theſe words vnto the idolatrous Church of Iſrael, yet his meaning was not, that God would make this
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:10737:154"/> new couenant of mariage with them, but with the whole Church in the time of the Goſpell, conſiſting of all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full both Iewes and Gentiles: for ſeeing they had been of old married vnto God, and were diuorced and caſt off for their ſpirituall whoredoms, it could not be fitly ſaid of them, that the Lord would eſpouſe or contract them to himſelfe, ſeeing they only are properly ſaid to be eſpouſed, who neuer before were taken to wife, but rather he ſhould haue ſaid of them, that he would againe be reconciled to her, and receiue her to grace.</p>
               <p>So that hereby wee are not to vnderſtand, that the Lord <note place="margin">The proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual mariage. 1. it is not te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porarie but perpetuall.</note> would renue or confirme the old couenant of workes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene himſelfe and the Church of Iſrael, for that was made fruſtrate by their ſpirituall whoredomes and rebellion, for which they were diuorced and reiected, but that hee would make a new couenant betweene himſelfe and all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the time of the Goſpell, receiuing them into this neere bond of mariage as pure and vndefiled virgins, the which is inuiolably to continue for euer and euer.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the parties contracted are Chriſt and his Church, ſignified in theſe words, <hi>I will marrie thee vnto me.</hi> Where by <hi>(thee)</hi> wee are not to vnderſtand the people of Iſrael accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the fleſh, but according to the ſpirit, that is, all the faithfull both Iewes and Gentiles; and by <hi>(me)</hi> wee are to vnderſtand Ieſus Chriſt, who in this ſpirituall mariage is vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his ſpouſe the Church, eſſentially and ſubſtantially, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die with bodie, and ſpirit with ſpirit, as before I haue ſhewed.</p>
               <p>And ſo much for the contract it ſelfe. The adiuncts hereof are, firſt the perpetuall continuance of this mariage: and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly the conditions thereof, which are as it were the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage bands, wherewith it is held inuiolable. The perpetuall continuance is noted in theſe words, <hi>for euer:</hi> where the Lord maketh a ſecret oppoſition between the couenant of works, made betweene him and the Iſraelites, and the couenant of grace, made betweene him and all the faithfull; for that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer mariage was not perpetual, but temporarie, and of ſhort continuance, becauſe the Church of Iſrael perfidiouſly vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:10737:154"/> her mariage faith, and perſiſted not in her loue and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience towards the Lord her husband, but forſaking him proſtituted her ſelfe to commit ſpirituall whoredome with falſe gods, and therefore was iuſtly diuorced from him, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we haue ſhewed; but the new couenant of this ſpirituall mariage betweene Chriſt and the faithfull, ſhall be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and inuiolable, becauſe he will write the lawes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions thereof, not in tables of ſtone, but in the fleſhie tables of their hearts, and will ſo rule and ouerrule them by his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Spirit dwelling in them, that they ſhall neuer breake their couenant, nor depart from the Lord their husband. The like places of Scripture, which may ſerue for an expoſition of this, wee haue Eſa. 54. 8. <hi>With euerlasting mercie haue I had</hi>

               <p>By all which places it is cleere and manifeſt, that the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant betweene the Lord and the faithfull is permanent and perpetuall, and that both in reſpect of God and of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and not only on Gods part, as the Papiſts would haue it, who affirme, that we may haue certaine aſſurance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of this couenant, in reſpect of God, becauſe hee for his part will moſt certainly performe the conditions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <note place="margin">

                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:10737:155"/> howbeit there is cauſe of doubting, that it will be viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and made fruſtrate by the faithfull, becauſe they may loſe their faith, and all other graces, and ſo forſake the Lord; but according to this doctrine there ſhould be no difference betweene the old couenant of works, and the new couenant of grace, in reſpect of the perpetuitie thereof, for that alſo on Gods part was moſt firme and permanent, ſeeing there was not one tittle of his promiſes which was not accompliſhed; neuertheleſſe on the part of the Iſraelites, it was made voide and fruſtrate, becauſe they performed not the condition of faith and obedience. Whereas the Lord promiſeth that his couenant with the faithfull, ſhould be perpetuall and euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, not onely on his part, but alſo on the faithfuls, becauſe hee would by the finger of his Spirit write his lawes in their hearts, Iere. 31. 33. and becauſe hee would alſo put his feare <note place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, whereas error and blindneſſe of iudgement, is a <note place="margin">2 The Church is married vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt in iudgement.</note> cauſe of diuorce and ſeparation, ſeeing thereby the wife is moued to preferre an adulterer before her lawfull husband; therfore that this may not be a cauſe of ſeparation betweene him and his Church, the Lord promiſeth that he will endue her with a cleare and wiſe iudgement, whereby ſhe ſhall bee able to diſcerne betweene good and euill, right and wrong: and how much more profitable will it be for her to embrace the Lord, as her only husband, louing, reuerencing, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying him in all things, than to forſake him, and to follow after her adulterous louers, that is, idols, the world, Satan, and the pleaſures of ſinne, which laſt but for a ſeaſon, and in the end bring euerlaſting deſtruction; and how much better it is to embrace his pure worſhip reuealed in his word, then to follow humane traditions and her owne inuentions?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the wife is moued to breake her coniugall fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <note place="margin">3. The Church is maried to Chriſt in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence.</note> and to leaue her husband, and follow her louers, when as ſhe is brought into doubt of his loue and good will, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:10737:156"/> of his illiberall cariage towards her, and when as by his niggardly reſtraining her of neceſſaries, ſhe is brought into extremitie and want; for then being hopeleſſe at home, ſhe rangeth abroad, and ſeeketh help of ſtrangers, when her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band neglecteth her. Whereas contrariwiſe, when ſhee hath aſſured teſtimonie of his loue, by his readines to ſupplie all her neceſſities to the vttermoſt of his power, it is a notable meanes to work in her loue towards him, and to preſerue her faith inuiolable. And thus it fareth in this ſpirituall mariage, when we doubt of Gods loue and fauour, and are brought into extreame exigents, through our ſpirituall or corporall wants, then our corrupt nature inclineth vs to leaue truſting and depending vpon the Lord, and to follow Idols, Saints, Angels and Images, looking for by them a ſupplie of that wherein we thinke that the Lord is defectiue. And therefore he heere promiſeth, that he will alſo marrie her vnto himſelfe in mercie, or as the word may more fitly in this place ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, in benignitie and beneficence, that is, that he will ſo mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplie vpon her mercies and benefits, as thereby ſhee ſhall haue full aſſurance of his loue and prouidence watching ouer her, and ſhall by his bountie be ſo furniſhed with all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, that ſhe ſhall not need to depend vpon any other. The which promiſe is accompliſhed, both in reſpect of corporal and ſpirituall benefits; for if the firſt be wanting, the Lord giueth the other in ſuch plentie and abundance, that in the middeſt of worldly wants, ſhe ſhal haue little cauſe to doubt of Gods loue and liberalitie, ſeeing he doth beſtow vpon her theſe rich treaſures, and gifts of greateſt value. And thus haue we this prophecie expounded, Ier. 32. 40. <hi>I will make an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting couenant with them, that I will neuer turne away</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>from them to do them good,</hi> &amp;c. 41. <hi>Yea I will delite in them to do them good,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, becauſe when the husband is of an auſtere, rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and impacable nature, ſo as he will not beare with his <note place="margin">4. The Church is married to Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion.</note> wiues infirmities, but puniſheth euery fault in all bitterneſſe and extremitie, it is a notable meanes to worke in her aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of minde, and to moue her to affect others more then
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:10737:156"/> him: and contrariwiſe, compaſſion and readines to pardon faults, and paſſe by infirmities, is a ſingular meanes to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh loue and fidelitie; therefore the Lord promiſeth in the next place, that he wil marrie the Church in mercy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; ſo that though through frailtie ſhe fall, and by her ſinnes offend him, yet this ſhall bee no ſufficient cauſe to moue her deſperately to forſake and flee from him, ſeeing he is ſo full of mercie and compaſſion, that ſhe can be no more readie to repent, then he to forgiue, nor to aske pardon, then he to grant it. And that not only for light and veniall ſinnes, nor for offences ſeldome committed, but for all her ſinnes moſt grieuous and innumerable: and this is implied in that he here vſeth the plurall number, ſaying, that he will marrie her in mercies, to note the multitude of his mercies, whereby he is readie to forgiue a multitude of ſinnes. The like place vnto this we haue, Ier. 31. 34. <hi>For I will forgiue their iniquitie,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jer</hi> 31. 34. <hi>Eſay</hi> 54. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>and remember their ſinnes no more.</hi> So Eſay 54. 10. <hi>The moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines ſhall remoue, and the hilles ſhall fall downe, but my mercy ſhall not depart from thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, becauſe all loue and benefits cannot reſtraine an <note place="margin">5. The Lord marrieth his Church in faithfulnes.</note> inconſtant woman, who is naturally addicted to luſt and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, but that vpon euery occaſion ſhe is apt to forſake her husband, and follow her louers: therefore in the next place the Lord ſaith, that he will marrie his Church in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes; wherby we are to vnderſtand, that not only the Lord himſelfe will continue faithfull and conſtant in his loue to the Church, but that alſo he will by his holy Spirit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with his Church and he are ioyned in marriage, ſo rule her affections, mortifie her naturall lightneſſe, and proneneſſe to ſpirituall adulterie, and confirme and ſtrengthen her in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie and fidelitie, that ſhee ſhall euer keepe her mariage faith inuiolable, and reſerue her ſelfe for him alone pure and vndefiled.</p>
               <p>Where we may further note, that he doth the third time repeate theſe words, <hi>I will marrie thee vnto me,</hi> to this end, that we might by this his redoubling of his ſpeech, bee the more vndoubtedly aſſured of the certaintie of this holy and
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:10737:157"/> heauenly contract, of which we are eaſily moued to make ſome queſtion, in reſpect of Gods glorious Maieſtie, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible greatneſſe, and in reſpect of our owne baſe vileneſſe and vnworthineſſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the wiues ignorance of her husbands perfections, <note place="margin">6. The Lord marrieth his Church in knowledge.</note> whereby ſhee neither knoweth nor acknowledgeth his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and good parts, and whereby as ſhe is often ready to vnderualue his worthineſſe; ſo alſo with an ouerweening conceit, to ouerprize the gifts and qualities of ſtrangers, is a notable meanes to alienate her mind from her husband, as being vnworthie of her loue, and to moue her to affect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: ſo the ignorance of the ſpouſe, the Church, of Gods excellencie, mercie, goodnes, and all perfections, is a chiefe cauſe that moueth her to leaue the Lord, and to follow her louers; for if ſhe did but know the Lord, ſhe ſhould need no other arguments to rauiſh her heart with his loue, nor any further inducement to moue her to forſake all others, and to embrace him alone with conſtant affection. And therefore the Lord in the laſt place promiſeth, that he will eternize the mariage betweene him and his Church, by illuminating her mind with a true knowledge of him; whereupon it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow, that ſhee will preferre him aboue all idols and falſe gods, ſeeing ſhe clearely perceiueth that he infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excelleth them all, in goodneſſe, perfection, and all true worthineſſe.</p>
               <p>The like promiſe we haue, Eſay 54. 13. <hi>And all thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall be taught of the Lord,</hi> Ier. 31. 34. <hi>And they ſhal teach</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>no more euery man his neighbour and euery man his brother, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, know the Lord, for they ſhall all know me from the least of them to the greatest of them, ſaith the Lord.</hi> So Ioel. 2. 28. 29. which was accompliſhed, Act. 2. 17. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joel.</hi> 2. 28. <hi>Act</hi> 2. 17.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now this knowledge of which he here ſpeaketh, is not ſo much what Chriſt is in himſelfe, namely, moſt infinite, moſt mightie, moſt wiſe, &amp;c. but eſpecially what he is vnto vs, to wit, a carefull head, and a moſt louing husband, who hath not only created vs, but alſo redeemed vs with his precious blood ſhead, and hereby obtained for vs the pardon of our
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:10737:157"/> ſinnes, reconciliation, ſanctification, and eternall ſaluation, who giueth vnto vs alſo all benefits ſpirituall and temporal, and protecteth vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all dangers. With which ſauing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whoſoeuer are indued, it is impoſſible they ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake Chriſt their husband, or preferre a ſtrange loue before the loue of him, who hath ſo dearely loued them.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I ſhewed the meaning of the words and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The Do∣ctrines. </seg>
                  </label> the chiefe points contained in them. In the next place wee are to conſider of thoſe doctrines which ariſe out of them, both for our inſtruction and conſolation. And firſt out of <note place="margin">Gods coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon his vndeſerued grace &amp; good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> this contract of mariage wee may obſerue, that the couenant of grace betweene God and his Church, is grounded vpon Gods free mercie and vndeſerued goodneſſe, without any condition of our owne workes and worthineſſe. Neither is it here ſaid, that hee would marrie the Church if ſhe were iuſt, holy, faithfull, and worthie his loue; but hee abſolutely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth, without all conditions that hee will marrie her, and being married, will endow her with righteouſneſſe, iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, pardon of her ſinnes, faithfulneſſe; ſo that theſe are not the cauſes mouing the Lord to eſpouſe the Church, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in his free loue he hath married her, therefore hee will proſecute her with his loue, and beſtow all theſe graces and benefits vpon her. But this moſt cleerely appeareth, whereas hee ſaith hee will marrie her in benignitie and mercie, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignitie preſuppoſeth the Churches want and pouertie, and mercie preſuppoſeth her miſerie, neither if ſhe were rich in her ſelfe ſhould ſhe neede the Lords beneficence, nor if ſhe were in happie eſtate ſhould ſhe neede mercie and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee may obſerue that the Lord alone is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this ſpirituall mariage: for when wee neither ſeeke nor deſire it, hee wooes vs, and alſo inclines vs to grant his ſuite. And therefore let the Lord haue the whole glorie of his owne worke, and let not vs rob him of any part thereof by aſcribing it to our owne free will, merits, or worthineſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we here leanre what is the great dignitie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie <note place="margin">The dignitie of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> of the Church, and of euery faithfull man: for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they are baſely eſteemed of in the world, and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="032" facs="tcp:10737:158"/> the very ofſcouring of al things, yet in truth there is none equall with them in honour and worthineſſe, ſeeing it hath pleaſed the Lord of Lords, and King of Kings to eſpouſe them vnto himſelfe. When <hi>Saul</hi> offered <hi>Dauid</hi> his daughter in mariage, hee thought it ſuch an high degree of honour, as he was altogether vnworthie of; ſo that in ſight of his owne meanneſſe he crieth out, <hi>What am I, and what is my life, or the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>familie of my father in Iſrael, that I ſhould be ſonne in law to the King?</hi> how much more then may we filled with rauiſhing, wonder, exclaime, what are we duſt and aſhes, miſerable and wretched men, that wee ſhould be aduanced to this royall dignitie, as to be the ſpouſe of the glorious King of heauen and earth.</p>
               <p>The vſe which we are to make hereof is, that if we are not <note place="margin">We muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall honour of the faithful.</note> as yet inueſted with this honour, we labour to attaine vnto it; for if we doe (as it is the nature of all men) deſire honour and preferment, why doe wee follow a ſhadow and neglect the ſubſtance? why doe we like children runne after the bubble of vaine and momentanie glorie, and in the meane time ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſeeke after that ſuperexcellent and eternall glorie of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſpouſed vnto God? eſpecially conſidering that worldly honour is vncertaine, both in getting and in the keeping; and ſeeing if wee labour after this honour of being married vnto God, wee ſhall moſt ſurely attaine vnto it; for the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe publiſheth and offereth this contract, and there can no impediment hinder it, vnleſſe we our ſelues forbid the banes. And ſecondly, thoſe that are aduanced alreadie vnto this height of honour, muſt neuer forget to be truly thankfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, who is the author of their aduancement, when they deſerued by their ſinner ignominie and diſgrace.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, wee may heere learne, that the pooreſt faithfull <note place="margin">The pooreſt faithfull man richer then the wealthieſt worldling.</note> man is in better eſtate, and poſſeſſed of more rich treaſures, then the wealthieſt Mammoniſt in the world; for they haue Chriſt himſelfe, and all his benefits; they are true owners of the treaſures of his righteouſneſſe and obedience; yea and by vertue of this ſpirituall mariage, they haue right and intereſt not only to all the temporall benefits of this life, but they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo haue the ioynter of Gods kingdome aſſured vnto them.</p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:10737:158"/>
               <p> Fiftly, being eſpouſed to God, let vs euer remembring this <note place="margin">We ought to behaue our ſelues as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth the ſpouſe of Chriſt.</note> honourable aduancement vnto which wee are preferred, ſo behaue our ſelues as beſeemeth our high place and calling. A Prince will not ſeruilely drudge for day wages, nor ſell his honor for a ſmall trifle, nor ſet his minde vpon baſe obiects; no more ſhould we, who by vertue of this royall mariage are called to higher honour, then the whole world affoordeth, ſpend our ſweate and labour to obtaine vncertaine richer and filthie pleaſures; wee ſhould not dimme our glorie, and impeach our honour, by behauing our ſelues like the ſlaues of ſinne and Satan, nor affect with the higheſt pitch of our deſires worldly toyes, and baſe trifles, ſeeing things of farre greater excellencie are reſerued for vs.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, as hereby wee may be put in minde of our honour <note place="margin">We muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall duties vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt.</note> and dignitie: ſo alſo of our dutie, namely, that being married vnto Chriſt, wee labour to performe vnto him all duties, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of a good wife, ſeeing he is wanting in nothing which belongeth vnto a moſt gratious and kinde husband; that is, let vs loue him aboue all the world, and ſhew our loue by our readineſſe to lay downe our liues for his ſake, who is our lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing husband, ſeeing he hath laid down his for vs, euen whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt wee were his enemies. Let vs yeeld vnto him voluntarie and abſolute obedience, and ſubmit our ſelues to bee ruled and guided by his word and Spirit. Let vs keepe our coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall fidelitie, reſeruing our ſelues pure and vndefiled, as from all other ſinnes, ſo eſpecially from idolatrie and ſuperſtition. Let vs who haue communion both in Chriſt and all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, not grudge to giue our ſelues and the beſt things we haue vnto him for the aduancement of his glorie, and the furthering of his worſhip and ſeruice; eſpecially let vs giue vnto him our hearts, which he ſo much deſireth. Let vs reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence him as our heauenly husband, fearing his diſpleaſure as the greateſt euill, and mourning for no loſſe ſo much as for the loſſe of his fauour. Let vs reſt &amp; wholly relie on his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, for the ſupplie of all our wants, and for protection from all dangers. In a word, let vs labour to performe all du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which belong to ſuch a husband, and to deck our ſelues with all graces, which may make vs appeare amiable in his
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:10737:159"/> ſight; and ſo wee ſhall confirme our ſelues in this aſſurance, that we are eſpouſed vnto Chriſt, and ſhal be made partakers not only of himſelfe, but alſo of all his benefits.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the doctrines which are to be obſerued out <note place="margin">Nothing can fruſtrate the couenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and vs.</note> of the contract it ſelfe. Now follow thoſe which ariſe out of the adiuncts and properties of this mariage, and firſt out of the perpetuitie thereof. Where firſt wee may obſerue to our ſingular comfort, that it is impoſſible for any thing whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to breake off the couenant betweene God and vs, or to make a ſeparation after hee hath once contracted vs to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in this holy mariage, nor all our ſpirituall enemies, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, the world, the fleſh, nor all the power of hell ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, no nor yet our owne ſinnes paſt, preſent or to come, for the Lord hath here promiſed, that he will eſpouſe vs vnto himſelfe for euer. Who therefore would not labour with his whole endeuour to attaine vnto this moſt honourable eſtate, accompanied with ſuch ineſtimable benefits, ſeeing they are infinitely more excellent in their owne nature, then all the glorie and riches of the world, and beſides they are eternall and neuer to be taken from vs. He that is in honour to day, may be in diſgrace to morrow; he that is now rich, may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a while be brought to extreame pouertie: but who ſo is aduanced to this ſpirituall honour, of being eſpouſed vnto God, ſhall neuer be depriued of it, neither in this life, nor in the life to come.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſeeing the vnion betweene Chriſt and vs is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall, &amp; ſeeing the bonds of this vnion is the Spirit of God, and a true and liuely faith; hence we learne that Gods Spirit and this faith, after we are married vnto Chriſt, ſhall neuer be taken from vs, for then the mariage bonds being broken, the mariage alſo ſhould bee diſſolued, which is contrarie to the promiſe of God in this place.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the things to be obſerued out of the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitie <note place="margin">Whoſoeuer are married vnto Chriſt are made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</note> of this mariage. Out of the properties and conditions thereof, we may further note theſe inſtructions. Firſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Lord promiſeth, that hee will eſpouſe the Church in righteouſnes: hence we learne that whoſoeuer are maried vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, they are alſo made righteous, that is, they are not
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:10737:159"/> only clothed with the wedding garment of Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe imputed vnto them, by which they are iuſtified in Gods ſight, but alſo are made righteous by the ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Spirit, dwelling in them; the which their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes conſiſteth in the integritie and vprightnes of their hearts, and in their earneſt and ſincere deſire, and endeauour to performe obedience vnto Gods Commandements; the which their obedience is in this life mingled with manifold infirmities and imperfections, but ſhal become perfect in the life to come.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we learne, that though this righteouſneſſe bee <note place="margin">Our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall.</note> weake and imperfect, yet ſhall it be perpetuall, euen as our mariage with Chriſt is perpetuall and eternall. And therefore although wee muſt worke out our ſaluation with feare and trembling, and labour earneſtly to haue this our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes more and more ſtrengthned and increaſed; yet when we feele our ſlow progreſſe in the pathes of righteouſnes, and finde it mingled with our great corruptions and imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, like a few graines of corne in a heape of chaffe, let vs not be vtterly diſcouraged, as fearing leſt this little ſparke of righteouſnes will be altogether quenched with the floud of our corruptions, ſeeing the Lord hath promiſed, that as this his couenant of mariage with vs ſhall bee perpetuall, ſo alſo that it ſhall for euer continue in righteouſnes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas the Lord promiſeth, that he will marrie <note place="margin">Our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe is not the cauſe of our vnion with Chriſt.</note> his Church in righteouſnes, not by chuſing her being righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but by making her righteous being choſen; hence we learne, that our owne righteouſnes is not the cauſe of this holy and happie vnion, but that this vnion is the cauſe of our righteouſnes: for after we are vnited vnto Chriſt by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, then this Spirit dwelling in vs, doth applie vnto vs the vertue of Chriſts death, which purgeth vs from, not only the guilt and puniſhment of ſin, but alſo from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, power, and dominion thereof; and the vertue of his reſurrection, whereby wee alſo are raiſed from the death of ſinne, to holines and newnes of life. And this notablie appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, Ezech. 16. 8. 9. 10. 11. &amp;c. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16. 8. 9.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas the Lord ſaith, that he will marrie his
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:10737:160"/> Church in iudgement: hence we learne, that whoſoeuer are <note place="margin">Thoſe who are married vnto Chriſt haue a ſound iudgement.</note> eſpouſed vnto God, they are ſo inlightned, and haue their iudgements ſo enformed by his word and Spirit, that they can diſcerne betweene truth and error, religion and ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, God and an idoll, and far preferre the ſincere worſhip of God reuealed in his Word, before their owne wilworſhip and humane inuentions; ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is not poſſible y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould be ſeduced and withdrawne from God and his pure ſeruice, to idols, and idolatrous worſhip, by all the ſlights and ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Satan, the world, Antichriſt, and all his falſe Prophets, as our Sauiour teacheth vs, Matth. 24. 24. becauſe the Lord <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 24.</note> hath married them vnto himſelfe in iudgement, wherby they are moued to prefer the excellencie of their husband Chriſt, and his reuealed will, before all their louers, and all their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring baites, with which they endeauour to draw them from him. Whence it appeareth that they who are drawne vnto idolatrie, or wedded to that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſtrumpet the world, and the vanities therof, are not indued with this ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d iudgement, and conſequently were neuer maried vnto Chriſt, 1.

               <p>Thirdly, whereas he promiſeth, that hee will marrie his <note place="margin">Chriſts bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits ſhould cauſe vs to loue him.</note> Church for euer in benignitie: wee learne hence, what vſe wee are to make of Gods manifold benefits which hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth vpon vs, namely, that they ſerue as helpes to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize our mariage with Chriſt, by knitting our hearts vnto him in true loue and entire affection. For what wife would not dearely loue a husband ſo bountifull and gratious, who neuer is wearie in beſtowing vpon her benefits, and in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king by all meanes her good and happines? eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that he requireth nothing elſe at her hands, but her heart and louing affection. But alas ſuch is our corruption, that wee cannot afford him thus much, yea rather as ſome wiues by their husbands benefits, do wax ſo wanton and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent, that they begin in the pride of their hearts to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne him, of whom they haue all their ornaments and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement: ſo do many of vs deale with Chriſt, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, whereas he ſaith, that he will marrie his Church <note place="margin">Our ſins muſt be no cauſe to alienate our minds from Chriſt.</note> in his mercies: hence we learne, that there is no cauſe, why our ſinnes ſhould alienate our minds from Chriſt, ſeeing ſo
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:10737:160"/> manifold are his mercies, that he is alwaies readie vpon our repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance to forgiue vs. It is a Machiauellian principle, put in practiſe by too too many in our daies, that whom they haue offended, thoſe they will neuer forgiue, becauſe in their ſelf-guiltie conſciences, they expect from him whom they haue iniured deſerued reuenge, and therefore to ſuch, one degree of wrong is an occaſion vnto another. This helliſh policie ſo odious in the ſight, euen of a ciuill ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, our corrupt nature is inclined to vſe towards Chriſt, for when we haue offended him, in ſtead of flying to him, and ſeeking reconciliation, we are readie to flee from him, and in guiltines of conſcience to diſtruſt of his fauour, and to ſeeke for helpe of Idols, Images, Saints, Angels, Popiſh pardons, and ſuch like wicked meanes, therein making amends for our former ſinnes, by adding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vnto them much more grieuous. But little cauſe haue we to be thus Italianate towards Chriſt, ſeing his mercies are infinite, ſo that he is alwaies readie freely to forgiue, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reconciliation wil neuer beare a ſecret grudge, nor watch for opportunitie of reuenge.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, whereas he ſaith, that he will marrie vs vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe <note place="margin">Our naturall vnfaithfulnes, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes through grace.</note> in faithfulnes: hence we learne, firſt, that by our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall diſpoſition we are vnfaithfull, and readie to breake the bond of marriage, by forſaking the Lord, and following idols, till the Lord giue vnto vs this ſingular gift of fidelitie. And ſecondly, being indued herewith, it is impoſſible there ſhould be a diuorce and ſeparation betweene vs, ſeeing the Lord for his part is moſt faithfull in keeping his couenant with vs, and ſeeing we alſo being indued with fidelitie, ſhall keepe our couenant with him, and ſhall neuer depart from him, as it is Ier. 32. 40. <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, whereas he promiſeth that ſhee ſhall know him: hence we learne, that naturally we walke in the darke vale of ignorance, till God illuminate our minds with knowledge, and that wee are thus illightned by vertue of our ſpirituall vnion with Chriſt, whoſe Spirit dwelling in vs doth with his bright beames diſpell the darknes of our minds, ſo as we are enabled in ſome meaſure to know God and his truth, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, 1.

               <p> Secondly, we here learne, that all thoſe who are truly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <note place="margin">Thoſe who are married vnto Chriſt are endued with ſauing knowledge.</note> vnto Chriſt, are endued with the knowledge of God, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this is one of the conditions of this happie contract, and that not only with a bare and idle ſpeculatiue knowledge, whereby they are able to diſcourſe of the nature of God, his perſons, attributes, and workes, ſeeing the diuels alſo can do this as well as they; but with a true ſauing and ſanctifying knowledge, whereby knowing we beleeue, and beleeuing applie vnto our ſelues, &amp; make profitable vſe of thoſe things which we know, concerning God and his truth, not onely for the rectifying of our iudgements, but alſo for the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of our affections, life, and conuerſation; as when know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods iuſtice and power, we be made thereby afraide to offend him; knowing his mercie, wee are moued thereby to loue and obey him; knowing his all-ſeeing and all-ruling prouidence, we be moued hereby to truſt and depend vpon him; knowing his omnipreſence, wee alwaies walke before him, &amp; ſo behaue our ſelues as in his preſence, &amp;c. So know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Chriſt is a Sauiour, we alſo know that he is our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and wholly and onely reſt vpon him for our ſaluation; knowing that he hath ſuffered death, ſatisfied Gods iuſtice, vanquiſhed Satan and all the power of hell, &amp;c. we alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that hee hath done all this for our ſakes: for as it hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth not the Phyſitian being ſicke, that he hath skill to make ſoueraigne medicines, not only for curing himſelfe, but alſo others affected with the like diſeaſes, vnleſſe he make vſe of his skill, and applie his medicines to himſelfe; ſo it will little auaile vs, though wee haue ſuch a great meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that we are able to informe our owne iudgements in the greateſt difficulties, and to inſtruct others alſo who are ignorant, vnleſſe we make vſe of our knowledge for our own benefit; it will little profit vs, that wee haue skill enough to cure others, of their diſeaſes of ſinne, by the precious potion of Chriſts blood, and the ſoueraigne baulme of his merits, vnleſſe we do apply them likewiſe vnto our owne ſoules and conſciences, for the recouerie of our health, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof ſerueth for the refuting of a twofold error: <note place="margin">Ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ideots and carnal hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</note> the firſt of ſecure worldlings, who liuing in their ignorance

The firſt ſort are to know, that whoſoeuer are eſpouſed vnto Chriſt, they are alſo indued with knowledge of him, and his truth; of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vtterly ignorant, they cannot challenge Chriſt for their husband, and conſequently can make no claime to any of his goods, bleſſings, and benefits. Neither can they haue any aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are of the Church, howſoeuer they are in the Church, ſeeing the Lord hath certainly promiſed that euery member thereof ſhall know him from the leaſt to the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of them, Iere. 31. 34.

               </p>
               <p>But let vs come to the words themſelues, wherein is ſet downe the time when God would endow his Church with theſe benefits, <hi>In that day;</hi> that is, in the time of the Goſpell, when he had made with her his new couenant of grace, and had knit her vnto himſelfe in this neere vnion of mariage.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the author of theſe gifts, namely, the Lord of hoſts, vnder whoſe rule and conduct all the whole armie of the creatures are ſubiected.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, here is expreſſed the benefit promiſed, namely, that he will make all his creatures both in heauen and earth to become his inſtruments and meanes to deriue his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings &amp; benefits vnto his ſpouſe the Church; in theſe words, <hi>I will heare the heauens,</hi> &amp;c. Where he alludeth to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie curſe threatned againſt the tranſgreſſors of the law. Deut. 28. 23. <hi>And the heauen which is ouer thy head ſhall be braſſe, and</hi>

                  <hi>the earth that is vnder thee iron.</hi> 24. <hi>And the Lord ſhall giue thee for raine of thy land, dust and aſhes,</hi> &amp;c. And ſheweth that after he hath made his new couenant with his Church, and is reconciled vnto her in Chriſt, his curſe ſhall be turned into a bleſſing. Now vnder this particular of hearing his Church in the time of dearth, he doth ſynecdochically promiſe, that he will heare and relieue her in all her wants and neceſſities, according to that, Ioh. 16. 23. And vnder theſe ſpeciall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 23.</note> of corne, wine, and oyle, are vnderſtood all temporall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits neceſſarie for the vſe and comfort of Gods Church: ſo Pſal. 4. 7. Yea vnder them wee are typically to vnderſtand all <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 7.</note> ſpirituall gifts and graces: for it was vſuall in the time of the law to prefigure the kingdome of Chriſt vnder the kingdom of <hi>Dauid,</hi> ſpirituall peace vnder worldly peace, eternall life vnder old age, the riches of heauen vnder the riches of the earth, our heauenly patrimonie and inheritance vnder the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:10737:162"/> poſſeſſion of the land of Canaan and the earthly Ieruſalem.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, here is ſet down the maner how and the meanes whereby he would deriue theſe bleſſings, by a notable gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; <hi>I will heare the heauen, and the heauen ſhall heare the earth,</hi> &amp;c. Where it is implied, that the meanes of obtaining the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall be prayer, the which by an hyperbolical metaphor, and wonderfull loftineſſe of ſpeech, is aſcribed to vnreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and vnſenſible creatures, though it properly appertain vnto man, that it might after a more emphaticall manner moue the mindes of the faithfull. The like figure is vſed in many other places: as Pſal. 93. 3. 98. 8. 107. 21. 27. Hab. 2. 11. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 93. 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 98. 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For the vnderſtanding whereof we are to know, that man is ſaid to call vpon food, when as there is dearth and ſcarcitie; and corne, wine and oyle are ſaid to heare him, or as the word here vſed ſignifieth hearing to anſwere him, when as they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelues vnto him for the ſupplying of his wants, in great plentie and abundance: And corne, wine and oyle are ſaid to call vpon the earth, when as the earth doth not bring them foorth, but through her barrenneſſe maketh a ſcarcitie of them: and contrariwiſe the earth is ſaid to heare them, when by her vertue, ſtrength and moiſture, ſhe affoordeth ſtore of theſe bleſſings. And ſo the earth is ſaid to pray vnto the heauens, when as wanting moiſture ſhe gapeth, and as it were earneſtly deſireth the firſt and latter raine, whereby ſhe may become fruitfull; and the heauen is ſaid to heare the earth, when accordingly ſhe diſtilleth her ſeaſonable and pleaſant ſhewers, whereby the earth and the fruites thereof are refreſhed. The heauen is ſaid to pray vnto God, when as her cloudes and vapours are dried vp, or reſtrained, ſo as ſhe cannot gratifie the earth with her moiſture; and the Lord is ſaid to heare her, when as he giueth vnto her vertue to gather cloudes and vapours, and open her windowes &amp; floodgates, ſo as ſhe may diſtill her ſweete drops to water the earth.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing here expreſſed, is the perſons vpon whom the Lord will beſtow theſe benefits, namely, all his elect and
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:10737:163"/> faithfull ones, whom hee hath eſpouſed vnto himſelfe, and theſe are comprehended vnder the name <hi>Iizreel;</hi> the ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of which word is here changed, neither is it here taken in the euill part, as it was Ch. 1. 4. to wit, for the ſeed of God, whom he would ſcatter and caſt away, but in the better ſenſe, for the ſeed of God whom he would gather into his Church, and ſtore vp in his garner of euerlaſting happineſſe. By which change of the ſignification the Lord would ſhew that his wrath was changed into mercie, and his iudgements into be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits in the time of the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>And that this name is ſo to be taken it appeareth by the verſe following, where the Lord following the allegorie, ſaith, that he will ſow her, that is, this <hi>Iizreel</hi> his holy ſeed: as alſo in that he changeth both the other names <hi>Lo-ruchamah</hi> into <hi>ruchamah,</hi> &amp; <hi>Lo-ammi</hi> into <hi>ammi;</hi> No mercie, into Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and Not my people, into Thou art my people.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of theſe words. The doctrines <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The Do∣ctrines. </seg>
                  </label> which ariſe out of them are theſe. Firſt wee may here learne, who is the author of all our bleſſings and benefits temporall <note place="margin">The Lord is the author of all bleſſings.</note> and ſpirituall, namely, the Lord himſelfe; for he it is that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs our corne, wine and oyle; he it is who cauſeth plentie and maketh dearth, and out of the garners of his al-ſufficient prouidence wee haue all our prouiſion and ſuſtenance. <hi>The eyes of all waite vpon him, and he giueth them their meate in due ſeaſon,</hi> and if he <hi>ſhut his hand, they all hunger and pine for want; if he open it, all things liuing are filled with plentie;</hi> as it is Pſal. 145. 15. 16. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 145. 15. 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The conſideration whereof ſhould moue vs, rather to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon the Lord for our plentie and prouiſion, then vpon the heauens, the earth, or the ſeaſons of the yeere, ſeeing he is the principall cauſe, and theſe but his inſtruments and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour meanes which he vſeth for our good. Secondly, if wee abound in theſe bleſſings, let vs praiſe the Lord in the fruitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them, and be readie out of our abundance to relieue the want and penurie of our poore brethren, as the Lord hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned vs; for all theſe temporall benefits, though good in themſelues, are not good vnto vs, vnleſſe they be receiued with thankſgiuing, and ſanctified to our vſe by the word and
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:10737:163"/> prayer, as it is 1. Tim. 4. 5. And if abounding with them we do <note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 5.</note> not communicate them with the poore, we commit the ſinne of the Sodomites, as appeareth Ezech. 16. 49. and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 16. 49.</note> make our ſelues obnoxious to their puniſhments.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we may here obſerue the time, when the Lord <note place="margin">The new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant is the fountaine of all our good.</note> beſtoweth theſe benefits vpon his Church, expreſſed in theſe words: <hi>And in that day,</hi> that is, in the day of her eſpouſals, when ſhe is married vnto Chriſt in righteouſnes, iudgement, &amp;c. and by Chriſt reconciled vnto God; for before this day we are not onely ſtrangers, but alſo enemies, and ſo remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſubiect to Gods wrath, we haue all the creatures oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt vs: but when wee are married vnto Chriſt, and in him reconciled vnto God, then all things work together for our good, and nothing is wanting vnto vs, which is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28.</note> for vs to receiue. From whence we learne, that this new couenant of grace betweene God and vs, and this ſpirituall marriage with Chriſt is the fountaine, from which all bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and benefits ſpring and flow vnto vs. And therefore if we would haue no good thing wanting, which we can deſire; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> let vs in the firſt place ſeek to be eſpouſed vnto Chriſt in righteouſneſſe, iudgement, benignitie and compaſſion, and then the Lord will ſupplie all our wants, and giue vs plentie of corne, wine, and oyle, and all other his benefits. And let vs auoid the practiſe of worldly men, who in the firſt place ſeeke for glorie, riches, houſes, lands, and pleaſures, and in the meane time neuer ſeeke to be eſpouſed vnto Chriſt, or in him to be reconciled vnto God, deferring this, as a matter of leaſt importance, to old age, or the end of life; but rather let vs <hi>In the first place, ſeeke the kingdome of God and his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>and then all other things ſhall be cast vpon vs,</hi> as our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath promiſed, Matth. 6. 33. Let vs firſt labour to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued into the couenant of grace, and to be eſpouſed vnto Chriſt Ieſus, and then he will inrich vs with the dowrie of all his temporall and ſpirituall benefits.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we here learne, that whatſoeuer vertue &amp; ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth <note place="margin">The creatures haue all their vertue from God, whereby they benefit vs.</note> is in any of the creatures to benefit, ſuſtaine, and nouriſh vs, they haue it wholly from the Lord, as appeareth by this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table gradation, for we cannot ordinarily liue without corne
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:10737:164"/> and food, we cannot haue theſe vnleſſe the earth bring them foorth for our vſe, the earth is barren and vnfruitfull, vnleſſe it be watered with the dew of heauen, the heauens haue no power to diſtill their fruitfull and pleaſant ſhewers vpon the earth, vnleſſe the Lord giue this vertue vnto them. So that he is the principall cauſe and firſt mouer, who ſetteth all inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our meanes on worke, and giueth them motion and ſtrength to deriue his bleſſings and benefits vpon man; neither can a drop of raine fall vpon the earth, nor the earth bring foorth one graine of corne, but by Gods prouidence and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and therfore we may conclude with the Apoſtle, that <hi>In him we liue, moue, and haue our being,</hi> Act. 17. 28. Is then <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 27. 28.</note> the earth fruitfull? let vs aſcribe the whole glorie vnto God; haue we a fertill ſoyle? let vs not reſt vpon it, but vpon Gods prouidence, for he that hath giuen it this power and vertue, can take it away &amp; make it barren. Is there a dearth and ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107. 34.</note> in the land? let vs not looke ſo much to the heauens, clouds, and weather, as vnto God the ruler and diſpoſer of them all, expecting and begging plentie at his hands, and ſo hee will heare the heauens, and the heauens the earth, the earth the fruits, and the fruits will heare vs, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we here learne, that howſoeuer the Lord is the <note place="margin">God beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings by infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour meanes.</note> principall cauſe, and chiefe author of all the benefits which we receiue; yet we are not to expect them from his hand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly, but mediatly, by inferiour cauſes and inſtruments, as appeareth by the gradation here vſed: and therefore wee are not idlie to expect food from Gods immediate proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, neglecting the ſubordinate meanes, as obſeruing the ſeaſons, and husbanding the ground with labour and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: for though he bee bountifull in beſtowing his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, yet he giueth them not to idle loyterers, but to painfull labourers, Gen. 3. 19. <note place="margin">

               <p>Fiftly, we may obſerue the infinite wiſdome of God, who <note place="margin">Gods wiſdom an making his creatures to ſtand in need of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers helpe.</note> hath lincked his creatures together in ſuch excellent order, as they haue need of one anothers helpe, and all depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, as vpon the firſt mouer. Man needeth food, food is not prouided without the helpe of the earth, the earth is not fruitfull without the dew of heauen, that heauens cannot
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:10737:164"/> ſend their raine without Gods bleſſing &amp; appointment. Where we may note, that man who is Lord of the creatures, ſtandeth in need of the meaneſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that whereas his ſoueraigntie might puffe him vp in pride, his neceſſitie which maketh him ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to the baſeſt creature, might teach him humilitie.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, wee may obſerue, that the chiefe meanes which the <note place="margin">Praier the chiefe meanes of obtaining all bleſſings.</note> Church is enioyned to vſe for obtaining of all benefits, is pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; as is implied by the manner of ſpeech here vſed, <hi>And I will heare ſaith the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. For howſoeuer the Lord hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to multiplie his mercies vpon the faithfull, yet not without the meanes of prayer &amp; inuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Becauſe if we did not firſt ſee and feele our wants, if ſeeing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we did not earneſtly deſire to haue them ſupplied, &amp; if to haue our deſire ſatisfied, we had not our recourſe vnto God by prayer, wee would neuer know nor acknowledge that we had receiued theſe gifts fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, nor bee thankfull vnto him for them, nor for the time to come depend vpon his prouidence. And thus do earthly parents deale with their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; although they are willing to ſupply al their wants, yet firſt they will be intreated, that hereby their loue &amp; affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards them may be endeared, and that they may learne obedience and reuerence, ſeeing their owne want of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents helpe, and their readines in granting ſuccour and reliefe.</p>
               <p>Seeing then praier is the meanes of obtaining all bleſſings <note place="margin">We muſt pray continully.</note> from God, the conduit whereby the cleare ſtreames of graces and benefits are deriued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, the fountaine of all goodnes, and the hand wherewith we fill our emptie ſoules in the ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe of Gods rich mercie, let vs continually exerciſe our ſelues in this holy dutie; and ſeeing our wants are continuall, <hi>Let vs pray continually,</hi> as the Apoſtle exhorteth vs, 1.

               <p> Seuenthly, whereas he ſaith, not that God <hi>will heare Iizreel,</hi>

               <p>Laſtly, we here learne, that all Gods gifts and benefits are <note place="margin">All benefits beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on man for the faithfuls ſake.</note> gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted vnto mankind at the ſuite of <hi>Iizreel,</hi> that is, for the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and elects ſake, and if it were not for them, the heauens would be as braſſe without raine and moiſture, and the earth as iron, barren and vnfruitfull.

The firſt in theſe words; <hi>And I will ſow her vnto me in the earth.</hi> The which ſpeech is allegoricall borrowed from the practiſe of husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who deſiring increaſe of their corne doe ſow it in the ground; ſo the Lord promiſeth that hee will ſow his Church, that is, he will multiplie and exceedingly increaſe it, as the ſeed is multiplied which is ſowne in the earth, ſo that it ſhall no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger be contained within the narrow borders of the land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, but be propagated farre and wide ouer the whole face of the earth. Where he alludeth to the name <hi>Izreel,</hi> ſignifying the ſeed of God, of which hee had ſpoken in the former verſe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the word <hi>(her)</hi> being of the feminine gender hath rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto the ſpouſe: for whereas his meaning was that hee would ſow <hi>Izreel,</hi> his ſeed, he ſaith he will ſow her, becauſe all this while he had ſpoken of his Church and faithfull people vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name and title of a wife.</p>
               <p>But beſides the multiplying of the Church, here is alſo, as I take it, promiſed the continuall ſtabilitie therof, for ſo this word
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:10737:166"/> ſowing or planting ſignifieth: as appeareth, Ier. 24. 6. <hi>I will plant them, and not roote them out:</hi> Pſal. 92. 13. 14. Ier. 31. 27. 28. 42. 10. <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Further he ſaith, that he will ſow her vnto himſelfe, where he noteth the end why he would multiplie his Church and people, namely, that they being choſen and called, might glorifie his name by ſeruing and obeying him; and this is the maine end not onely of our calling, but alſo of our creation and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: 2. Cor. 6. 20. Epheſ. 1. 4. Tit. 2. 14. <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, whereas hee ſaith, that hee will ſow her in the earth, without any ſpecial reſtraint vnto any particular place, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that hee would ſow her thorowout the whole earth, and no longer confine her within the limits of Canaan; the which promiſe was accordingly accompliſhed, when Chriſt gaue commandement to his Apoſtles and Diſciples, that they ſhould goe teach all nations, Matth. 28. 20. the which they alſo performed, as appeareth in the Acts of the Apoſtles. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And this is the promiſe concerning the multiplying of the Church. Now the meanes whereby hee would increaſe it to ſo great a number is expreſſed, whereas he ſaith that hee will haue mercie vpon <hi>Lo-ruchamah,</hi> and will call <hi>Lo-ammi</hi> his people; wherby he vnderſtandeth the calling not only of the ten tribes, but alſo by occaſion of them the Gentiles amongſt whom they were ſcattered; as the Apoſtle plainly expoundeth this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie, Rom. 9. 24. &amp; 1. Pet. 2. 10. for of whom it might be ſaid, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 24. 25. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 10.</note> that they were without mercie and not Gods people, of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he promiſeth that he would haue mercie, and chuſe them for his people: but this might be ſaid, not of the Iſraelites alone, but alſo of the Gentiles, as the Apoſtles teſtifie; and therefore of them alſo this prophecie is to be vnderſtood.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the meanes whereby the ſeed of the faithfull is multiplied. In the laſt place he ſetteth downe the diſpoſition, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and dutie of the Church being called, in theſe words: <hi>And they ſhall ſay, thou art my God.</hi> Where there is implied the entire loue of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church towards God, in that ſhe vſeth here the vocatiue caſe (as the originall hath it) and by a certaine kind of hearty acclamation, crieth out, <hi>O my God:</hi> which briefe maner of ſpeech doth moſt pathetically expreſſe the otherwiſe vnexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable affection &amp; paſſion of the heart. So <hi>Thomas</hi> rauiſhed with Chriſts aſſured preſence crieth out, <hi>My Lord and my God,</hi> Ioh. 20. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20. 28.</note>

Thirdly, that ſhe ſhall inuocate and call vpon his name, as is ſignified in this phraſe of ſpeech, <hi>O my God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of theſe words. The doctrines which <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The do∣ctrines. </seg>
                  </label> ariſe out of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are theſe. Firſt, whereas y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord ſaith, that he will ſow his Church, hence we learne that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord is the ſole cauſe of <note place="margin">The Lord is the principall cauſe of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the Church. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 5.</note> the multiplying of his Church, by his word and Spirit, and not our owne inclination and free will; for we are as ſeed in the hand of the ſower, vnleſſe hee husband vs, wee will euer remaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull, Eph. 2. 5. And this the Apoſtle affirmeth, namely, that the <hi>faithfull are not borne of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God,</hi> Ioh. 1. 13. <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, we learne here, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Lord doth ſow or multiplie the Church vnto himſelf, that is, for his own glory, worſhip, and ſeruice, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Church being choſen to be a royall Prieſthood, and holy nation, may abſtaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fleſhly luſts, &amp; haue their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation honeſt, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſo God may be glorified euen of thoſe that are without. And therfore ſeeing the Lord hath made choice of vs for this purpoſe, let vs labour to attaine vnto our end, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we can haue no aſſurance that we are in the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Gods people, ſeeing it is impoſſible y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſhuld be fruſtrate of his end.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by this cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of names; no mercy into mercy, &amp; no <note place="margin">Gods anger turned into loue.</note> people into a people: we learne, that in the time of the Goſpel, Gods anger is turned into loue, iudgement into mercy, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into reward, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demnation into life &amp; ſaluation, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Chriſts merits &amp; mediation. The which ſerueth notablie for the conſolation of al thoſe, that mourne in Sion, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beaten downe by the apprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſion of Gods anger, the ſight of ſinne, and the curſe of the law, they conſider that Chriſt hath freed them from them all, reconciled them vnto God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for them remiſſion of their ſinnes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we here learne that the wall of ſeparation is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <note place="margin">The Iewes and Gentiles gathered into one Church.</note> downe, &amp; both Iewes and Gentiles admitted into one and the ſame Church, ſo that as our Sauiour ſpeaketh, there is now <hi>but one ſheepfold &amp; one ſhepheard,</hi> Ioh. 10. 16. See p. 125. 133. 135.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, we here learne, that our vocation was altogether free and vndeſerued; for when as we were without mercy, deſeruing <note place="margin">Our vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is of free grace.</note>
                  <pb n="320" facs="tcp:10737:167"/> rather iudgement &amp; condemnation, the Lord had mercy vpon vs; &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we were no people, but aliants &amp; ſtrangers, yea ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vnto God, the Lord of his free grace made vs his people yea of his owne familie: and this the Apoſtle plainly ſheweth, 2. Tim. 1. 9. As therfore no conceit of our own worthines ſhould <note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9.</note> make vs to derogate any from Gods free grace, &amp; vndeſerued loue, ſo neither ought our vnworthines cauſe vs to doubt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſeeing without reſpect of our deſerts, the Lord hath choſen vs.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, we here learne, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our ſaluation hath his beginning in Gods mercy; for by reaſon of our ſins, we are in miſery, &amp; in the <note place="margin">Gods mercie the beginning of our ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> ſtate of condemnation, the which our miſerable condition is ſo much the more miſerable, in that of our ſelues we cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie come out of our miſerie; but God in mercy pardoning our ſins, for Chriſts merits, freeth vs from our wretched eſtate, and aduanceth vs to all glorie and happineſſe.</p>
               <p>Seuenthly, this ſerueth notably for the conſolation of euerie <note place="margin">The faithfull are conſident in Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</note> true me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the Church, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are aſſured y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Gods mercy: ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> though they haue falle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, they need not with <hi>Adam</hi> to hide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fident aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of pardon &amp; forgiuenes, go bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnto the throne of grace, that they may receiue mercy &amp; find grace to helpe in the time of need: as it is, Hebr. 4. 16. 10. 22. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hebr.</hi> 4. 16. 10. 22. As God chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vs, ſo we chuſe him.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, we here learne, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord maketh choice of vs to be his people, ſo we anſwerably muſt make choice of him to be our God; as he ſheweth his loue towards vs, ſo we muſt be ready to expreſſe ours towards him, by our holy obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; zeale of his glory; as he profeſſeth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are his people, aboue &amp; before al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s not called, ſo we muſt not only inwardly know and beleeue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he is our God &amp; in our hearts performe ſeruice vnto him, but we muſt ſay w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Church in this place, <hi>O my God;</hi> that is, acknowledge &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe that he is our Lord &amp; Sauiour, ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly and in the ſight of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; publikely performe vnto him his pure worſhip &amp; ſeruice, which he requireth in his word, &amp; that not only whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by our profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> glorifying God we grace our ſelues, but alſo when we incurre thereby ſhame &amp; reproch, affliction, and perſecution. In a word, we muſt with the Church here in all our need and neceſſaries, inuocate and call vpon Gods name, and wholly depend vpon, and expect from him all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie for this life, and the life to come.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Chapter the Lord ſheweth, that <note place="margin">The argument of the Chapter.</note> howſoeuer the Church of Iſraell had grieuouſly offended him by her Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, vnthankfulneſſe, and voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; yet hee did not ceaſe to loue her, and in his loue to ſeeke her conuerſion and ſaluation; and therefore becauſe fond and cockering loue would but cauſe her to continue in thoſe her ſinnes to her vtter deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, his purpoſe was, to afflict and chaſtice her with a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and tedious captiuitie, wherein ſhee ſhould liue in a poore and contemptible eſtate, vnder the tyranny of her eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, without her owne lawes, magiſtracy, or any forme of gouernement, and without the publike meanes of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping eyther God or her Idols. Howbeit leaſt ſhee ſhould deſperately ſincke vnder the waight of this tedious and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous affliction, hee promiſeth that in the end, after that by his chaſtiſements he hath humbled her, hee will conuert and turne her vnto himſelfe, by true repentance and ſo receiue her into his former grace and fauour.</p>
            <p>And this is the maine argument of this Chapter, out of <note place="margin">The generall parts.</note> which wee may obſerue the parts thereof, which are two: The firſt is a teſtification of Gods loue towards the Church of Iſraell, verſe 1. The ſecond is an approbation of this loue by a two-fold fruit thereof: the firſt is by inflicting on her fatherly chaſtiſements, that ſo ſhe might be reſtrained from
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10737:168"/> running on in her ſinnes to her perdition: The ſecond is the ſanctifying of this affliction to her vſe and benefit, namely, for her true Repentance and conuerſion to God.</p>
            <p>And theſe are the generall parts of this Chapter. Now the maine drift and ſcope of all is, that the Lord might containe <note place="margin">The ſcope of the Prophecie.</note> the people in an euen courſe, ſo as they ſhould neyther pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly and ſecurely goe on in their ſinnes without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, nor deſperately ſinck vnder the guilt and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them. For whereas their preſent proſperity might cauſe them ſecurely to promiſe vnto themſelues immunitie from puniſhment, and Gods former promiſes of inriching and multiplying the Church of Iſraell, might cauſe them to imagine, that though the Lord ſuffered them to be led into captiuitie, yet hee would in ſome ſhort time deliuer them, and ſpeedely aduance them to all happineſſe, by multiplying vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them the former benefits; the Lord meeting with this their ſecurity and preſumption, aſſureth them that he would not ſo eaſily forget their grieuous ſinnes, whereby they had ſo long and often prouoked him, but before he would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled vnto them, his purpoſe was, ſeuerely to correct them with a miſerable Captiuitie, wherein they ſhould bee grieuouſly afflicted with pinching pouerty, and baſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and that not for a ſhort ſpace, but for a long time, euen vntill the comming of the Meſsias.</p>
            <p>And on the other ſide, whereas when they were grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly afflicted they might eaſily be moued to doubt of gods loue, and to thincke their eſtate deſperate, both becauſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and calamitie doth cauſe men more clearely to ſee, and more ſenſibly to feele the haynouſneſſe of ſinne, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the wrath of God due vnto them; and alſo in that they found and felt the fruites of Gods anger, loading them with afflictions, and withall might doubt that they ſhould neuer againe be reconciled vnto God, or be made partakers of any of his gratious promiſes, ſeeing they were ſo long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, and their puniſhments ſo tediouſly continued: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord giueth them ſome comfort in the middeſt of trouble by aſſuring them, that notwithſtanding their mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ſinnes, yet hee loued them, that in loue hee did chaſtiſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10737:168"/> and correct them for their conuerſion and amendement, and that howſoeuer their afflictions were grieuous and tedious, yet they ſhould not continue for euer, for after hee had by them, made them to forſake their Idolatry and other ſinnes, he would admit them to be his Church and people, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue them in his feare and pure worſhip.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <p>ANd this is the maine ſcope and chiefe end of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie. In the next place we are to ſpeak of the ſpecial parts thereof: And firſt, of the teſtification of Gods loue to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Church of Iſraell. Ver. 1. <hi>And the Lord ſaid vnto</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe. </seg>1</label> 
                  <hi>me, goe yet and loue a woman, beloued of her huſband, and was an harlot; according to the loue of the Lord towards the children of Iſraell, yet they looked to other Gods &amp; loued the wine bottles.</hi> In which words the loue of God is typically propounded, <note place="margin">The expoſition</note> and afterwards plainely expounded: it is typically ſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnder another viſion, not much vnlike vnto the former. Chap. 1. 2. wherein the Lord commaundeth the Prophet to loue an adulterous and vngratefull harlot, not that indeed he would haue him to ſet his affection vpon ſuch an one, ſeeing it was a thing vnlawfull and diſhoneſt for the Prophet of God to loue an Adultreſſe; being another mans wife, but that hee hauing receiued this commaundement by viſion, might propound it as a Parable vnto the people, that hereby they who were dull of conceit, might ſee both the loue and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God, and their owne wickedneſſe and vnworthyneſſe repreſented as in a cleare glaſſe or plaine picture. As though he ſhould ſay, go yet againe vnto the Iſraelites and propound this parable vnto them: that the Lord is like vnto a husband, who continueth to loue his wife, though ſhe neglecting his loue and forgetting his benefits, haue forſaken him, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted whoredome with her louers, and giuen ouer her ſelfe vnto all voluptuous pleaſures.</p>
               <p>But let vs come to the words more particularly: <hi>And the Lord ſaid vnto mee,</hi> that is, after I had deliuered the former Prophecie, the Lord againe ſpake vnto me by viſion, ſaying: <hi>goe yet againe,</hi> that is, content not thy ſelfe to haue ſpoken once of my mercy, loue and gracious benefites, and of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10737:169"/> wickedneſſe and vnworthineſſe of this people: but againe repeate and reiterate theſe things vnto them, that ſo eyther they may be moued at the ſecond hearing, or that their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie and hardneſſe of heart may be manifeſted, and they left without excuſe. <hi>And loue a woman beloued of her huſband and was an harlot:</hi> that is, by propounding vnto them this Parable, ſhew them that I am a gracious Husband, in that notwithſtanding their manifold whoredomes, I continue to loue them, and withall conuince them of their groſe wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and vnthankfulneſſe, in that all my loue and gracious benefits will not reſtraine them from committing Idolatrie and ſpirituall adultery with falſe Gods.</p>
               <p>In which Parable, vnder the husband wee are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand God himſelfe, who loued his people from all eternitie, and continued conſtant in his loue euen after the people had broken their mariage faith, plighted vnto him in mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai, and committed ſpirituall whoredome with falſe Gods. By the wife wee are to vnderſtand the people of Iſraell, and not the people of Iuda, as ſome haue imagined; for firſt, in this firſt verſe here mention is made of the children of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell: and ſecondly, it is not true of the Iewes, that they ſhould be without Magiſtrates and gouernement, for the Scepter might not depart from Iuda till the Meſsias came. <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 10 <note place="margin">Gen. 49. 10.</note> But is was verified in the ten tribes, who had no Magiſtrates of their owne in the time of their captiuitie.</p>
               <p>Yea, but the ten Tribes were diuorced from God, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of the couenant and for euer debarred of mercy; how then could it be ſaid of them, that God loued them as his ſpouſe, and that they ſhould, being conuerted, ſeeke the Lord?</p>
               <p>I anſwere that we are not to vnderſtand theſe words ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally of the whole people of Iſraell, but of thoſe onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeſt them, which belonged to Gods election, for of theſe alone it could truely be ſaid that God loued them, and that being conuerted they ſhould ſeeke the lord. And vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it of them, we may eaſily anſwere the former obiections, for though they were excluded out of the couenant of works, yet this hindreth them not from being admitted into the couenant of grace; though they were debarred of mercy
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10737:169"/> in reſpect of their deliuerance out of a temporall captiuitie, yet they obtained mercy in regard of their ſpirituall freedom out of the captiuitie of ſinne and Sathan; though they were for euer exiled out of the earthly Canaan, yet being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled vnto God in Chriſt, they might neuertheleſſe become Citizens of the heauenly Ieruſalem.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, by the Prophet, who is commaunded by God to loue this Adultreſſe beloued of her husband, wee are to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Ieſus Chriſt, who loued theſe elect Iſraelites which were exculded out of the couenant of works, and marryed them vnto himſelfe, by making with them the new couenant of grace; and this appeareth in that hee willeth him to loue her with ſuch loue as the Lord loued her, namely, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, moſt infinite, and eternall loue, which properly can be aſcribed to no other, ſauing to our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt alone.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of this parable: The expoſition followeth: <hi>According to the loue of the Lord towards the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſraell; yet</hi> (or when as) <hi>they looked to other Gods, and loued the wine bottles.</hi> In which words the Lords loue is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyfied by the wickedneſſe and vnworthineſſe of the people, and the peoples ſinne aggrauated by the loue and goodneſſe of God towards them. The Lords loue is hereby commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, in that he did not onely loue this people whileſt they loued him, kept their coniugall faith, and ſerued him accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his word, but euen when they diſpiſed him, forſooke him, violated their faith, and committed ſpirituall whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome with falſe Gods; the which he could neuer haue done had not his loue beene infinite, moſt conſtant, and eternall.</p>
               <p>Secondly, their ſinne and wickedneſſe is exceedingly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauated, in that they were ſo vngratefull and obſtinate in their Idolatry, that neyther Gods loue, nor all his manifold benefits which he had multiplyed vpon them, as pledges of his endleſſe loue, could moue them to loue him againe, nor containe them in their fidelitie, nor reſtraine them from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſpirituall fornication with falſe Gods. If a wife doe not loue her husband who loatheth her and behaueth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe towards her cruelly and inhumanely, though this doth
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:10737:170"/> not altogether take away her fault, yet it doth much extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and excuſe it; but if ſhe loue not ſuch a husband as entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loueth her, nor will be reſtrained by his great kindnes and manifold benefits, from breaking her faith and following her louers, her fault is ſo haynous that it admitteth of no excuſe; but ſuch a louing husband was the Lord to this Church of Iſraell, and ſuch a rebellious and vnfaithfull wife was ſhe to him, and therefore her wickedneſſe was ſo much the more grieuous and intollerable.</p>
               <p>But let vs come to the particular branches of their ſin: the firſt whereof is expreſſed in theſe words: <hi>Yet they looked to other Gods:</hi> by which phraſe, with the Hebrewes is vſually ſignified loue and deſire, hope and truſt repoſed in that thing which they are ſaid to looke after. Wheras therefore they are ſaid to looke after other Gods, the meaning is that they ſet their hearts and affections vpon them, and hoped and truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them, and in theſe reſpects had their eyes and mindes alwayes fixed vpon them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he ſaith that <hi>they loued the wine bottles;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee may eyther generally vnderſtand that beſides their ſinne of Idolatry, they were alſo addicted to all manner of vnlawfull pleaſures and luxurious exceſſe, as ſurfetting and drunkenneſſe, laſciuiouſneſſe and wantonneſſe (for with the corruption of Religion is vſually ioyned corruption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Pietie and Honeſty, being ſuch twins as both liue and die together) And if we take the words in this ſence, then we are to vnderſtand them Synecdochecally; dunkenneſſe being put for voluptuouſneſſe and all corruption of manners, of which he maketh ſpeciall choyſe that he may perſiſt in the former Allegory, ſeeing Adultery &amp; Drunkennes are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ioyned together, and are mutuall cauſes one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Or els we may take them more ſpecially and properly, for that drunkenneſſe and thoſe voluptuous delights, which they vſed in their Idolatrous feaſts, for with their Idolatry they vſually ioyned feaſting and reuelling, as may appeare. <hi>Exod.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 32. 6.</note> 32. 6. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 9. 27. vnto which cuſtome the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludeth. <note place="margin">Iudg. 9. 27.</note> Chap. 2. 8. <hi>They drinck the wine of the condemned in</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Amos. 2. 8.</note>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:10737:170"/> 
                  <hi>the houſe of their God.</hi> The which cuſtome laſted vnto the Apoſtles time, as appeareth. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 21. and this as I take <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 21.</note> it, is the more naturall and proper ſence of this place, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the people of Iſraell did not onely commit Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, but alſo by their drinking, feaſting and reuelling, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the exceeding great delight which they tooke in their ſinne.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of theſe words: The doctrines <note place="margin">Our proneneſſe to fall into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation or preſumption.</note> which ariſe out of them are diuers. Firſt we may obſerue out of the generall ſcope of this Chapter our exceeding proneneſſe to run into two extreams, ſecure preſumption, &amp; abiect deſperation, in reſpect of our diuers eſtate and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: when we are in proſperity we are deafe to all reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, admonion &amp; threatnings, we flatteringly perſwade our ſelues, that this Sunne of Gods fauour will euer ſhine vpon vs, notwithſtanding that our ſinnes continually aſcend, and as a thick cloud interpoſe themſelues betweene vs &amp; the beams of Gods loue; and when we heare Gods curſes, we bleſſe our ſelues in our hearts ſaying: <hi>I ſhall haue peace although I walk</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 29. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>according to the ſtubberneneſſe of mine owne heart, adding drunkenneſſe vnto thirſt,</hi> as it is, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29 19. Yea when the Lord beginneth to puniſh, we are ready in the ſecuritie of our hearts to promiſe vnto our ſelues immunitie, and to ſay with thoſe wicked men. <hi>Eſay.</hi> 28. 15. <hi>We haue made a couenant with</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſay. 28. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>death, and with hell we are at agreement, though aſcourge run ouer, and paſſe through, it ſhall not come at vs, &amp;c.</hi> And on the other ſide, when God withdraweth from vs his gracious countenance, and taking away our proſperitie, in ſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of layeth vpon vs affliction and aduerſitie, then we are as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to fall into the contrary extreame, concluding that God hath vtterly reiected vs, and caſt vs off for euer, fooliſhly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that when our Sunne of comfort is once ſet, and the night of ſorrow and aduerſitie hath ouerſhadowed vs, that it will neuer ariſe againe and repleniſh our hearts with ioy and conſolation. An example hereof we haue in the Iſraelites, in this place, and in <hi>Dauid. Pſal.</hi> 30. 6. 8. The conſideration whereof ſhould moue all Gods Miniſters according to the practiſe of the Prophet in this place, wiſely to intermixe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:10737:171"/> comminations with conſolations, iudgement with mercy, threatnings with promiſes, and the Law with the Goſpell, that they may keep men in an euen courſe, and in the golden meane, neither preſumptuouſly going forward in ſin, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of Gods mercies and benefits, nor deſperately ſincking vnder the waight of ſinne and puniſhment, when they are ouertaken of Gods iudgements.</p>
               <p>Secondly, whereas the Lord commandeth the Prophet <note place="margin">That Gods mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters muſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten inculcate their inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions.</note> yet againe to put the people in minde of his mercyes, and their owne ſinnes and vnworthineſſe; hence we obſerue that it is not ſufficient for Gods Miniſters once alone to ſtand vpon theſe points, but conſidering how forgetfull men are of Gods benefits, and how obdurate and obſtinate in their wicked courſes, they muſt repeate, &amp; beate vpon theſe things againe and againe; neuer thinking any duety ſufficiently taught, which is not alſo ſufficiently learned. Neyther muſt they ſeeke to pleaſe the itching eares of phantaſticall hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, who are impatient in hearing the ſame things twiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered, nor ſeeke to delight ſuch ſurfetted and cloyed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites as cannot indure oftner then once to taſt of the ſame food, no nor yet take pleaſure though varietie of food be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vnto them, if it be brought in the ſame diſh, deſiring onely varietie, and to heare continually new matter, out of a new Text: but they muſt like good Surgeons apply the ſame ſalues to the ſame ſores till they be perfectly cured, they muſt ſpeake againe and againe of the ſame mercyes of God till they bee remembred, teach the ſame doctrines till they be learned, exhort to the ſame dueties till they be prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, and reproue the ſame ſinnes till they be amended. And like good houſe-holders, as they are to auoid the glutting of the family, by the continuall vſe of the ſame meate: ſo alſo they muſt oftner then once ſet before them that ſpirituall food, which they know is good and wholeſome, and think it no diſgrace and diſparagement to their plenty and hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie, if they feed twiſe of the ſame diſh.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we may obſerue that the Lord propoundeth his <note place="margin">The vſe of Parables.</note> mercyes and the peoples ſinnes, by way of Parable, that ſo he might in a liuely manner, and as it were, with reall words
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10737:171"/> repreſent theſe things to their vnderſtanding, as it were in a plaine picture; that ſo he might hereby more effectually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue his owne vndeſerued goodneſſe, and conuince them of their vnworthines, and this forme as it is alwayes delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſo is it ſometimes moſt profitable, as when Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are to deale with Magiſtrates, or with obſtinate and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent ſinners, who wil not know nor condemne ſinne, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be in another mans perſon. See Chap. 1. Ver. 2.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, wee may obſerue that the Lord intending to <note place="margin">The aſſurance of gods loue our chiefe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> arme his children with ſuch patience as might inable them to beare thoſe grieuous afflictions which he purpoſed to lay vpon them, doth in the firſt place aſſure them of his loue, notwithſtanding he ſeuerely corrected them for their ſinnes: yea that he therefore did chaſtice them becauſe he loued them, and would not ſuffer them to goe on in their ſinnes to their deſtruction; whence we learne that to attain patience in afflictions and aduerſitie, the beſt way is, earneſtly to labour that we may diſcerne with the eye of faith the beames of gods loue and fauour, through the cloud of our ſinnes and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticements, and not onely to looke vpon the rod, but alſo vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the hand of our louing father, who beateth vs that he may correct and amend vs. For if wee bee perſwaded with <hi>Paul,</hi> that afflictions cannot <hi>ſeperate vs from the loue of God.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 35.</note> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 35. Then ſhall we alſo with <hi>Paul, reioyce in tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Rom.</hi> 5. 3. And conclude with <hi>Iob, that though he kill vs, yet we will truſt in him. Iob.</hi> 13. 15. If in our greateſt extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities we haue this hope and aſſurance that we are beloued of God it will be a ſure anker-hold to preſerue vs from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſhip-wrack of our ſoules vpon the ſands of deſperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though we be toſſed and turmoyled with the tempeſts of tribulations and the ſurging waues of troubles, it will be a ſure piller to vnder-prop our fainting ſoules, ſo as they ſhall not ruinouſly ſincke vnder the waight of affliction, and an impregnable fort, into which being retired as our laſt place of refuge, we ſhall eaſily beare off and beate back the moſt violent battery that affliction and aduerſitie can make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, we may obſerue how hainous and odious this ſin
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10737:172"/> of Idolatry is in the ſight of God, in that he compareth it to <note place="margin">The hainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie.</note> Adultery, for as nothing can be more deteſtable in the eyes of a louing and iealous husband, then that his wife ſhould affect others more then him, and proſtitute her ſelfe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit whoredome euen in his ſight and preſence: ſo nothing can be more odious in the ſight of God, then that his church ſhould thus deſile her ſelfe with ſpirituall Adultery, euen in his preſence. See Chap. 1. Ver. 2.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, in the example of the Iſraelites wee may behold our exceeding great ingratitude, in that being dearely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <note place="margin">Our ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> of God we doe not loue him againe, but are ready to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Idols and Images before him. Who would not wonder at the vnthankfulneſſe of ſuch a woman, who being baſe and beggerly, deformed, diſeaſed and full of ill qualities, ſhould be choſen and eſpouſed to a prince of great worth, and deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloued of him; if notwithſtanding his excellency and loue, ſhe ſhould defile her mariage bed and preferre ſome baſe groome before him? but ſuch is our ingratitude, if being aduanced from ſuch a baſe condition, to ſuch high dignitie by our husband Ieſus Chriſt, we ſet our mindes vpon Idols more then on him.</p>
               <p>Seauenthly, wee may heere obſerue the Conſtancie of <note place="margin">The Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of Gods loue.</note> Gods loue towards his elect, in that notwithſtanding their grieuous ſinnes and great vnworthines he continueth to loue them; for though the Iſraelits after they were eſpouſed vnto God committed ſpirituall whoredome, &amp; forſooke the Lord, yet he ſendeth his Prophet to aſſure them of the continuance of his loue. So neither the fall of our firſt parents, nor the originall corruption which was propagated from them vnto vs, nor our own manifold actuall tranſgreſsions, could break off his loue, wherewith he had loued vs from all eternitie, but that ſtill euen <hi>whilſt we were ſinners, he ſent his ſonne to dye for</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 8. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>vs,</hi> and <hi>whileſt we were enimies vnto him he reconciled vs vnto himſelfe by the precious death and bloodſhed of our Sauiour,</hi> as <note place="margin">Iohn 3. 16.</note> the Apoſtle ſheweth. Rom. 5. 8. 10. Ioh. 3. 16.</p>
               <p>The conſideration whereof ſerueth notably for our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, when as we labour and groane vnder the heauy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of our ſinnes, for if the Lord ſo dearely loued vs euen

Secondly, by ſanctifying this her affliction for her conuerſion, verſ. 5. The afflictions which he intended to correct her with, are
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10737:173"/> typically repreſented and ſhadowed in the Prophets viſion, verſ. 2, 3. And after, this viſion is in part expounded verſ. 4. Concerning the former, he ſheweth firſt the end wherefore hee afflicted her, that is, that thereby he might buy her, and ſo poſſeſſe and keepe her for his owne vſe, in theſe words: <hi>So I bought her to me:</hi> and ſecondly hee ſetteth downe the affliction it ſelfe; where firſt he ſheweth with what kinde of affliction he meant to chaſtiſe her, namely with captiuitie, ſignified in this phraſe of buying her: and ſecondly he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth the qualitie of this captiuitie, to wit, that it ſhould be exceeding grieuous, and that both in reſpect of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their miſeries, which they ſhould ſuffer in their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie, and alſo in reſpect of their long continuance. Their miſeries conſiſted partly in the euils which they ſuffered, and partly in the depriuation of ſuch benefits as they had formerly inioyed, namely their politicall and eccleſiaſticall gouernment, verſ. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>The euils which ſhe ſuffered were baſe contempt, ſignified by her price, of 15. peeces of ſiluer, wherewith ſhee was bought; and pinching pouertie and want, ſignified by the Homer and a halfe of Barley.</p>

                  <hi>bought her to mee for fifteene peeces of ſiluer, and for an Homer of Barley &amp; an halfe Homer of Barley.</hi> In which words is contayned both the peoples puniſhment, and the loue of <note place="margin">The expoſition</note> God, who inflicted it: the puniſhment is, that they ſhould become captiues in a ſtrange countrie; and this is ſignified by this phraſe of buying, for no free people, but onely cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, ſlaues and ſeruants were bought for money. So that the meaning of this part of the viſion is this; as the Prophet buyeth an adultrous wife as though ſhe were a captiue: ſo the children of Iſraell ſhall be led into captiuitie, and bought and ſould for money.</p>
               <p>Yea but the Prophet was commanded to loue this adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe, and heere no mention is made of his loue, but onely that he bought her, that is, brought her into the baſe eſtate of a ſlauiſh captiue; how then doth this ſignifie the loue of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10737:174"/> God, ſeeing it ſeemeth rather an effect of hatred? I anſwere if we reſpect Gods end, which was the profit, conuerſion and ſaluation of the Iſraelits, this was a ſingular note of gods loue. For when they abuſed their libertie to all licentiouſneſſe, God cauſed them to liue in captiuitie, but to this end, that by this miſerie he might reclaime &amp; regaine them vnto himſelf. So that the Lords ſeueritie was exceeding profitable and neceſſarie to reforme this adultreſſe, and to make her keepe her marriage faith inuiolable for the time to come, when as ſhe felt the ſmart of her vncleanneſſe. If a husband laying aſide his right of ſuperioritie and rule, doe baſely cocker and flatter his adultrous Wife, and ſuffer her at pleaſure to raunge abroad and company with her louers, his fondneſſe will harten her in her wicked courſes, and cauſe her the more to ſcorne and contemne him; the Lord therefore like a wiſe husband dealeth otherwiſe here with this adultreſſe, that is, he retayneth his authoritie, he handleth her roughly, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayneth her of her libertie, but yet inwardly he loueth her, for he doth all this to coole the heat of her luſt, and to make her chaſt and faithfull, that ſo being reclaymed, hee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue her into his wonted fauour.</p>
               <p>The Next point to be conſidered is the baſeneſſe of their eſtate in their captiuitie, ſignified by the price here giuen for the Adultreſſe, to wit, fifteene peeces of ſiluer. What was the preciſe quantitie of this ſumme it is vncertaine, neyther is it materiall to the vnderſtanding of the Prophets purpoſe, onely this we are to know, that the Prophet maketh menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a certaine price giuen, that he might in more liuely manner ſet forth this viſion as a thing done, &amp; hereby more feelingly affect his hearers: &amp; ſecondly, that this Adultreſſe was bought at a very low rate, ſeeing there is ſuch a ſlender price payed for her, as fifteene ſiluer peeces.</p>
               <p>For there was three ſorts of ſiluer coyne in vſe amongſt the Iſraelites, the Shekell of the Sanctuarie, which was about two ſhillings foure pence in value, and this had on the one ſide <hi>Aarons</hi> rod, and on the other, the pot of Manna: the common or halfe Shekell, amounting to foureteene perice; and the Gerah or Obolus, which was about the value of our
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10737:174"/> three halfe-pence. Now we are not to vnderſtand theſe words of the Shekell of the Sanctuary, which was onely the price of holy things, and therefore not of an adultreſſe; and if wee vnderſtand them of the common Shekell, then the whole price amounted but to the ſumme of ſeauenteene ſhillings and ſixe pence, which was giuen for this Adultreſſe: whereby the baſe eſtate and contemptible condition of this harlot is ſhewed, in that ſhe is valewed at leſſe then a ſlaue or cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. For if an Oxe gored a ſeruant, the owner was bound to giue to the maiſter thirtie Shekels in recompence, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21. 32. and here this Adultreſſe is prized but at <note place="margin">Exod. 12. 32.</note> halfe ſo much, whereby is ſignified that the people of Iſraell ſhould be contemned and exceeding baſely eſteemed of in their captiuitie. And this agreeth with the complaint of the faithful. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44. 12. <hi>Thou ſelleſt thy people without gaine, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſa. 44. 12. 13</note>

               </p>
               <p>And this is the firſt part of the price: the other is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in theſe words: <hi>And for an Homer of Barley, and halfe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ezech. 45. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>an Homer of Barley.</hi> The Homer, or Chomer contained ten Ephaes, as appeareth. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 45. 11. and the Epha was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a pottle leſſe then our buſhell, whereby is ſignified, firſt the ſlauiſh condition of the people in their captiuity, for Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley was eaten onely of ſlaues and captiues, and not of free women: ſecondly their pouerty which is noted by the ſmall quantitie of this courſe fare, alotted vnto them as their onely ſuſtenance for a long time; ſo that their fare was both courſe and ſparing: thirdly here is imployed the Lords loue in that he gaue them ſome maintenance for the preſeruation of life, and but a ſparing meaſure of courſe foode, that hereby hee might humble and reclaime them.</p>
               <p>The meaning then of this part of the viſion is, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet bought the adultreſſe, ſo ſhall the people be bought and ſould, and liue like ſlaues and ſeruants; as he bought her at a low &amp; baſe rate, euen for halfe the price of a ſeruant, ſo they ſhalbe baſely eſteemed and meanly valued more like vaſſels and ſlaues then the ſpouſe of God; as he doth not giue vnto
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10737:175"/> her Wheate but Barley, and that in ſmall quantitie, ſo the Lord will afflict them with courſe dyet, whereof they ſhall not eate vnto ſaciety but ſparingly by meaſure, as if the Lord ſhould haue ſaid; ſeeing you haue abuſed your liberty vnto licentiouſnes, and when the reigne was laied on your owne necks haue runne away from me like vnrulie colts, therefore I will bridle and curbe you in with captiuitie, and make you to returne vnto mee; ſeeing euery baſe trifle hath moued you to ſell your ſelues to be ſlaues to ſinne, I will alſo cauſe you like ſlaues to be bought and ſould at vile rates; ſeeing you haue abuſed your honourable eſtate, vnto which I called you, namely, to be my Church and people, and haue thereby bene puffed vp in pride, I will humble you with your enimies contemptible &amp; diſdainefull vſage of you; ſeeing your plentie and proſperitie hath made you to forget and neglect me, I will rub your memorie with pouerty and want, but yet I will not leaue you comfortleſſe, for I will not vtterly forſake you and ſuffer you to periſh in your penurie, but will allow vnto you ſome poore maintenance, and by my hard vſage I will not deſtroy you, but buy you that is, reclaime and reduce you againe vnder my gouernment.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of the words: The inſtructions hence to be gathered are theſe. Firſt wee may obſerue that the Lord approueth his loue to the people of Iſraell, by <note place="margin">Afflictions a ſigne of Gods loue.</note> thoſe afflictions which hee layeth on them, to the end that he may reclaime them from their ſinnes. For as there is no greater ſigne of Gods hatred and our rejection, then when the Lord giueth vs ouer vnto our ſelues, to doe what we liſt, to proſper in our ſinnes, and without any checke to run for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the wayes of wickedneſſe, to our deſtruction; ſo can there not be a more euident ſigne of his loue, then when like a carefull father he correcteth vs, that he may not diſinherite vs, and maketh the pleaſures of ſinne loathſome vnto vs, by mingling them with the Wormewood of afflictions.</p>
               <p>And hence it is that the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>that whom the Lord loueth he chaſteneth, and he ſcourgeth euery ſonne whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth.</hi>

And this <hi>Dauid</hi> well knew by his owne experience, and therefore he ſayth, Pſal. 119. 67. <hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray, but</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſa. 119. 67. 71</note> 
                  <hi>now haue I kept thy word.</hi> And verſe 71. <hi>It is good for me that I haue beene afflicted, that I may learne thy ſtatutes.</hi> When our heauenly Phyſition dyeteth vs from the pleaſures of ſinne, which we loue better then out meate and drincke, &amp; giueth vs the bitter pils and loathſome potions of afflictions, it is a ſigne that he intendeth the cure, and that there is ſome hope of our recouery; but when he letteth vs haue whaſoeuer we luſt after, and letteth our appetite bee the onely rule of our diet, it is a ſhrewde token that he hath giuen vs ouer as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a deſperate cure: when our father ſuffereth vs to goe on in all wicked and licentious courſes, it is a ſigne he neglecteth vs, and meaneth to diſinherite vs: when our Lord and mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter lets vs neglect all dueties without controlement, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers vs to goe on in our ſtubborneneſſe and diſobedience, without any reproofe or correction, hee makes it manifeſt that his purpoſe is to turne vs out of his ſeruice; and when he lets vs feed at will in the pleaſant paſtures of ſinne, it is more then probable that hee hath deſtinated vs to the ſlaughter.</p>
               <p>The vſe which we are to make hereof is: firſt, that wee <note place="margin">The vſes.</note> faint not in our afflictions, imagining that they are ſignes of Gods hatred, and our rejection; but beare them with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, conſidering the Lord hereby ſheweth his loue and care ouer vs: eſpecially let vs be not onely patient, but alſo ioyfull and thankfull, when the Lord croſſeth vs in our ſins, and reſtraineth vs from going forward in any courſe of wickedneſſe; for ſuch afflictions are bleſſed which preſerue vs from Gods eternall curſe, and that is a ſweet chaſtiſement which keepes vs from being condemned with the world.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:10737:176"/>
               <p> Secondly, ſeeing the Lord in loue correcteth vs, that hee may reclaime vs from our ſinnes, let vs, when we ſuffer any affliction, labour to finde out our ſinnes, bewayle them, and turne from them vnto the Lord by true repentance; and then the ſame loue which moued the Lord to correct vs, will alſo moue him when we are reformed, to eaſe vs of our affliction, neyther will he cauſe vs any longer to drink theſe bitter potions, when hee hath already recouered vs of our health.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wee learne to iudge charitably of thoſe whom the Lord exerciſeth with afflictions, and not to imagine that becauſe any are extraordinarily afflicted, therefore they are more then ordinary ſinners, as the Iewes did. Luke. 13. 1. 2 <note place="margin">Luk. 13. 1. 2.</note> And the Barbarians. Act. 28. 4. For then we ſhall <hi>condemne</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, wee may here obſerue what fearefull puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <note place="margin">The punniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.</note> the Lord inflicteth vpon thoſe Idolaters whom hee purpoſeth to conuert and ſaue: firſt, Captiuitie vnder their enimies; for when they will not ſerue the Lord who loueth them, the Lord will make them ſerue their foes who hate them. Secondly, Ignominie and baſe contempt, for thoſe that diſhonour God by their Idolatry and vnthankfulneſſe, the Lord will cauſe them to be diſhonoured, ſcorned, and reproched. Thirdly, Pouerty and want, for thoſe that will not be thankfull to the Lord for his benefits, nor imploy them to his glory; he will depriue them of them, and by their penury teach them to acknowledge him, the author of them: Thoſe that forget God by reaſon of their fulneſſe, he will cauſe them through emptines and want, to call him to their remembrance. Where wee may note how the Lord fitteth his puniſhments to their ſinnes, becauſe they refuſed to vſe their liberty to gods glory, in worſhipping and ſeruing him, but rather abuſed it to the ſeruice of ſinne and Sathan, the Lord made them Captiues and ſlaues to their enimies; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not moued by that high degree of honour of being Gods peculiar people, to giue glory vnto God; but grew hereby proud and diſdainfull, the Lord deiecteth them
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:10737:176"/> into a baſer eſtate then the vſuall condition of a ſeruant or Captiue: becauſe by their fulneſſe and luxurious exceſſe in all dainties and delicateneſſe they were growne wanton, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull of God, and vnthankfull, the Lord cureth their ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet, by allotting them courſe and ſlender dyet.</p>
               <p>And ſo much concerning the firſt part of their miſerie, conſiſting in the euils which they ſuffered. The ſecond part reſpecteth the good things whereof they were depriued, which was their communion with God, and the comfortable fruition of his preſence, &amp; alſo of the outward ſignes thereof, both in the Eccleſiaſticall and politicall gouernement, and in his publike worſhip and ſeruice. And this is ſet downe ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pically. Verſe 3.

Now becauſe it might ſeeme ſome wrong, if the Prophet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraying this adultreſſe from all others, ſhould in the meane while reject her and make choyſe of ſome other wife, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to comfort her that ſhe might beare her widdow-hood with greater patience, he aſſureth her that in the meane time hee will make choyſe of no other, but remaine ſingle and alone as well as ſhe. And this he ſignifieth in theſe words, <hi>And I will be ſo vnto thee,</hi> that is, as thou ſhalt not come at mee nor match thy ſelfe with any other, ſo I will neither joyne my ſelfe vnto thee as yet, nor in the meane time, reject thee vtterly and make choyſe of any other, but I will remaine ſingle as well as thou, that when thou haſt giuen ſufficient teſtimony of thine vnfayned repentance, I may againe joyne thee vnto my ſelfe in marriage.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of the words being vnderſtood typically, of the Prophet &amp; the adultreſſe, which being fitted vnto the Lord and the Church of Iſraell (which are the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties repreſented in this type, by the Prophet and the Harlot)
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:10737:177"/> doe ſignifie thus much; that howſoeuer the Lord ſo loued this harlot the people of Iſraell that he tooke care of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion and ſaluation, and to this end vſed meanes, that ſhee might forſake her idols &amp; ſpirituall whoredome, yet ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and odious were her adultries and vnthankfulneſſe in his ſight, that he would not be reconciled vnto her and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her into the former communion of marriage, till by many tryals &amp; much experience, ſhe had giuen aſſured teſtimony of her vnfayned repentance. And therefore his purpoſe was to afflict her with a tedious captiuitie, wherein hee would reſtraine himſelfe from her &amp; haue no communion with her, either in reſpect of politicall or eccleſiaſticall gouernment, for neither ſhould ſhe haue any form of a common wealth, wherein hee ſhould rule as their King, nor of a Church, wherein hee ſhould bee worſhipped as their God, with ſuch publike ſeruice as he required in his word: and as he would reſtraine them of the publike meanes of his worſhip, ſo alſo he would not ſuffer them to forſake him, and to make choyſe of other Gods and ſo to commit ſpirituall whoredome with their idols, as they had done in former times, but they ſhould keepe themſelues from idolatrie, waiting the Lords leaſure, till in his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt he would be reconciled vnto them, and againe contract them vnto himſelfe in marriage.</p>
               <p>Now becauſe this tedious captiuitie and confuſed anarchie ſhould not be without comfort, therefore the Lord giueth them ſome teſtimonie of his loue, by aſſuring them that hee would as well waite for their true conuerſion, as they for his mercy, and that in the meane time he would not reject them, and make choyſe of ſome other people to be his Church, but would ſtay his choyſe till vpon their true repentance hee might receiue them into his former loue and fauour.</p>
               <p>And this is emphatically ſignified in theſe words, <hi>And I wil be ſo vnto thee:</hi> wher the Lord not doth explicate his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at large, but (like thoſe whoſe mindes are exceedingly perturbed with griefe, indignation, or ſome ſingular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration) he vſeth this abrupt and broken ſpeach, as though it ſo much grieued him to deferre reconciliation, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hould the outward teſtimonies of his loue from his people,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:10737:178"/> that he was not able to pronounce this his definitiue ſentence at large, but in theſe abrupt and broken ſpeeches. So that here is Iudgement mixed with Mercie: Iudgement in that he with-houldeth from them the ſignes of his loue for a time; Mercie in that he with-houldeth them not for euer; Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that he would not as yet admit them to be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; Mercy in that for their ſakes he wil make choyce of no other, but expecteth their repentance, that thereupon hee might be reconciled vnto them.</p>
               <p>But againſt this there may be made two obiections; firſt <note place="margin">An anſwere to a two-fold ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</note> that this teſtimonie of Gods loue, and hope of their future reconciliation, will not ſtand with Gods former threatnings, namely, that hee would no more haue mercy vpon them; Chap. 1. Ver. 6. That they ſhould not be his people, nor he their God. Ver. 9. That hee had vtterly diuorced and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected them. Chap. 2. Ver. 2. And ſecondly, that it will not ſtand with the euent, ſeeing the Lord did neuer after eſpouſe this whole people, nor yet them alone. Both which obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are taken away with one anſwere: namely, that this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie is not to be vnderſtood of the whole body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but of the faithfull amongſt them, which belonged to Gods Election; of which it is truely verified, ſo as it may well ſtand with the former Prophecie, and the future euent. For though he rejected the whole body of this people, yet he reſerued a remnant, according to the Election of grace, <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 5.</note> whom after their repentance and conuerſion he did eſpouſe to him: and for theſe hee reſerued his grace, ſo as he would not after the people were excluded from the outward coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, admit of any other, neyther before the comming of Chriſt, nor after he was come, till he had called and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled them; and ſo vpon occaſion of their calling and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, hee called alſo and conuerted the elect Gentiles, amongeſt whom they were ſcattered, and to them both, who only were the true Iſraelites, according to the ſpirit, he made good his promiſes of mercy and grace: and this appeareth. <note place="margin">Math. 10. 5. 6. 15. 24. 26. Act. 13. 46.</note> Mat. 10. 5, 6. &amp; 15. 24, 26. Act. 13. 46.</p>
               <p>And ſo much for the expoſition of the words: the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which from hence ariſe are theſe. Firſt, whereas the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:10737:178"/> Lord ſaith, that he will not preſently be reconciled vnto the <note place="margin">Length of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction no ſigne of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</note> Church of Iſraell, but ſhe ſhall waite his pleaſure, and bee content to liue in an afflicted eſtate, vntill hee ſaw fit time of giuing vnto her aſſurance of his loue and fauour: hence we learne to arme our ſelues with patience, when our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are tediouſly continued, and not deſperately to caſt aſide all hope, as though the length of our afflictions were a ſigne of our vtter rejection; for as it appeareth in this place, the Lord cauſeth the afflictions, euen of thoſe that belong to his Election, to endure for a long time together, and maketh them to wayte and expect, till hee ſeeth the fit time for their deliuerance. Examples hereof we haue in the captiuitie of Aegypt, and Babilon, in <hi>Dauid, Iob</hi> and many others.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is, that though our afflictions be of long <note place="margin">We muſt waite vpon God for deliuerance fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our afflictions.</note> continuance, we waite the Lords leaſure, and poſſeſſe our ſoules with patience; and ſo in the end wee ſhalbe aſſured of deliuerance. An example hereof we haue in <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſal. 40. 1. <hi>I wated patiently for the Lord</hi> &amp;c. In the faithfull grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly <note place="margin">Pſal. 40. 1. and 123. 2. Eſay. 8. 17.</note> afflicted. Pſal. 123. 2. Eſay. 8. 17. in <hi>Iacob</hi> Gen. 49. 18.</p>
               <p>Which duety that we likewiſe may performe let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider: firſt, that the Lord inioyneth and requireth it at our hands. Pſal. 37. 34. <hi>Wayte thou on the Lord, and keepe his</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 37. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that the Lord wayteth vpon vs, that hee may finde vs fit to receiue his mercy, that is, humbled in the ſence and feeling of our owne miſery and want, and earneſtly hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring after his grace. Eſa. 30. 18. <hi>Yet therefore will the Lord</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſay. 30. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>wait, that he may haue mercy vpon you.</hi> Seeing then the Lord wayteth on vs to ſhew mercy, great reaſon haue we to wait, that we may receiue mercy; for waiting and attending bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter becommeth ſuiters then benefactors.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, let vs waite vpon the Lord, becauſe the holy Ghoſt commendeth it vnto vs, as a good thing. Lamen. 3. 26 <note place="margin">Lamen. 3. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>It is good to truſt and to waite for the ſaluation of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, if being afflicted, we doe not onely watch, but alſo wayte in prayer, it is a good argument, to confirme our faith in this aſſurance, that our prayers ſhall be heard, and our petitions graunted; and therefore the Church vſeth this
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:10737:179"/> reaſon for the ſtrengthening of her faith. Eſay. 33. 2. <hi>O Lord</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſa. 33. 2</note> 
                  <hi>haue mercy vpon vs; we haue wayted for thee.</hi> And Mich 7. 7. <note place="margin">Mich. 7. 7.</note> ſhe joyneth theſe two together, <hi>I will wait for God my ſauiour: my God will heare.</hi> Of this <hi>Dauid</hi> had experience Pſa. 40. 1. <note place="margin">Pſal. 40. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>I waited patiently for the Lord, and hee inclined vnto mee and heard my cry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, becauſe our waiting and patient abiding the Lords leaſure, ſhall aſſuredly haue a good iſſue: for he will not ſuffer thoſe that wait vpon him to goe away aſhamed. Eſay. 49. 23. And howſoeuer <hi>the hope of the afflicted</hi> may bee <note place="margin">Eſa. 49 23.</note> deferred, yet it <hi>ſhall not periſh for euer.</hi> Pſal. 9. 18. But thoſe <note place="margin">Pſa. 9. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>that attend the Lords leaſure, in the end ſhall be exalted, &amp; haue the land in poſſeſſion.</hi> Pſal. 37. 34. <hi>They ſhall be ſaued and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 37. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>from all euill.</hi> Pro. 20. 22. Yea they ſhall be eternally <note place="margin">Pro. 20. 22</note> bleſſed. Eſay. 30. 18. <hi>The Lord is the God of iudgement; bleſſed</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſa. 30. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>are all they that wait for him.</hi> Howſoeuer therefore the hope of the <hi>afflicted being deferred,</hi> is for the preſent, <hi>bitter and irkeſome,</hi> yet in the end <hi>their patient abiding ſhall be gladneſſe,</hi> as it is. Pro. 10. 28. <note place="margin">Pro. 10. 28.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be obſerued is, that the Lord will not preſently be reconciled with his people, and ſhew vnto <note place="margin">God trieth our Repentance by afflictions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vs to fauour.</note> them the wonted ſignes of his fauour, till he hath taken tryall of their repentance by manifold afflictions; and this he doth not ſo much to approue their vnfayned repentance to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, for hee ſearcheth the heart and raignes, and therefore needeth not theſe outward ſignes; but firſt that by theſe ſignes, their owne faith may be aſſured, that they are truely conuerted, ſeeing they endure the tryall with patience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue ſinned. Secondly, that he may ſhew his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of ſinne, in that he will not eaſily be reconciled, euen with thoſe whom hee dearely loueth, when they haue grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly offended Thirdly, that by theſe corrections he may make them carefull for the time to come, that they doe not againe by their ſinnes prouoke his diſpleaſure; for hee that with a wounded conſcience and broken ſpirit, hath long ſought and ſued for mercie, and hath ſpent many a bitter ſigh and grieuous grone before hee could attaine vnto the aſſurance of gods fauour, hauing obtained it will not eaſily be
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:10737:179"/> allured againe by his ſinnes to hazard and looſe it. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that hereby he may glorifie his name, by approuing his iuſtice and righteous iudgements euen to thoſe that are with out, when as they ſee that he will not winke at ſinne, no not in his deareſt children; who otherwiſe would take occaſion vpon their ſinne and impunitie to blaſpheme. 2 Sam. 12. 14. <note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 14.</note> Laſtly, that hee may hereby teach the wicked what they are to expect, for if the Lord ſo correcteth thoſe ſinnes in his children which of infirmitie they haue committed, how will hee puniſh the ſinnes of wicked men which they commit with full conſent of will? If he be diſpleaſed with the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and will not preſently aſſure them of his fauour, after they haue repented, then what can they looke for that continue in their ſinnes without repentance, but that he will poure vpon them the full viols of his wrath? If he ſo ſeuerely chaſtiſeth ſinne in his ſonnes and friends, how grieuouſly will he puniſh it, in ſlaues and enimies? examples hereof we haue in <hi>Adam, Dauid, Ezechias,</hi> the people of Iſraell, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is, that we carefully take heede that wee doe not wound our Conſciences, by committing againſt our knowledge grieuous ſinnes, ſeeing we are aſſured if wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto God that hee will ſharply chaſtiſe vs for it; and will not ſuffer the beames of his loue comfortably to ſhine vpon vs, till wee haue approued our repentance by many tryals, and haue indured much more griefe and ſorrow, through our croſſes, and the reſtraint of his loue, then our pleaſure and delight was in the committing of our ſinnes; and therefore let vs not to pleaſe the fleſh wound the ſpirit, nor purchaſe a dram of carnall delight, with a pound of ſorrow.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this may ſerue to comfort and refreſh vs, when as we are ready to ſincke vnder the waight of ſinne, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie burthen of affliction, and in regard hereof are readie to conclude that we are caſt out of Gods fauour; for then wee are to remember that the Lord oftentimes reſtrayneth the ſignes of his fauour, and continueth the afflictions of thoſe, whom notwithſtanding, he dearely loueth for the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes aboue ſaid, &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:10737:180"/>
               <p> Thirdly, whereas the Lord ſaith, that ſhee ſhall ſtay for <note place="margin">God afflicteth vs for ſin that we may learne to hate it.</note> him in her afflicted eſtate, and ſhall not play the harlot, &amp;c. hence we learne, that the reaſon why the Lord continueth to reſtraine his fauour, and to afflict his people, is not becauſe he hateth them, but that hereby they may bee moued more ſeriouſly to repent, and to flye from their ſinnes with greater deteſtation, when they ſee theſe miſerable effects that follow them. If our heauenly father, when wee grieuouſly offend, ſhould cocker vs, and ſhew no ſigne of his diſpleaſure, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat offended, ſhould preſently be reconciled vs; we finding no bitterneſſe neyther of Gods anger, nor of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, which might cauſe vs to diſtaſt the ſweet pleaſures of ſin, would neuer ſoundly and ſeriouſly repent of them: but when we apprehend his heauie diſpleaſure, and cannot with much entreaty be aſſured of reconciliation; when wee feele the ſmart of ſharp afflictions, and can by no meanes find eaſe, then we call our ſinnes to remembrance, and are grieued at the heart that we haue committed them; then we hate and deteſt them, as being the fountaine from which doe flow theſe waters of bitternes; and then we reſolue with our ſelues, that if our heauenly father will but this once forgiue, and be reconciled vnto vs: if he will but cauſe the wonted beames of his fauour to ſhine vpon vs, and eaſe vs of the heauie bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of our afflictions, we will neuer againe be perſwaded ſo by our ſins to prouoke his diſpleaſure, though all the profit, pleaſures, and preferment of the world were offred vnto vs.</p>
               <p>The vſe which we are to make hereof is, that when the Lord doth exerciſe vs with afflictions, we exerciſe our ſelues in repentance, and make the day of tribulation, the day of humiliation; for this is the maine end why the Lord afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs, which when he hath attained, hee will put an end to our afflictions: and therefore the way to eaſe our ſelues of the burthen of puniſhment, is to caſt away the burthen of our tranſgreſsions; the beſt meanes to lighten our ſoules with ſauing comfort, is to loade them with bitter ſorrow for ſinne; if we would haue God well pleaſed with vs, we muſt be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with our ſelues; and if euer we meane to come vnto
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:10737:180"/> the pallace of ioy, wee muſt trauaile vnto it by the path of mourning. For <hi>bleſſed are they that mourne, for they ſhall bee</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 4. Luke. 6. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>comforted. Bleſſed are they that weepe, for they ſhall laugh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, whereas the Lord ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not play the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">God onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> running head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into ſinne</note> 
                  <hi>Harlot,</hi> not ſo much by way of prohibition, teaching them what he would not haue them doe, as by actuall reſtraint, ſhewing what he would cauſe and inable them to refraine, notwithſtanding their proneneſſe thereunto, through their naturall corruption: hence we learne what is the chiefe cauſe whereby we are with-held from running headlong into all manner of ſinne; namely, Gods powerfull word, which as it ſaith, Thou ſhalt not ſinne, ſo it enableth vs through the ſecret operation of his ſpirit, to yeeld obedience. For in our owne naturall diſpoſition, we are ready to draw ſinne vnto vs, as with Cart-ropes, and to drincke iniquitie like water, <note place="margin">Eſay. 5. 18.</note> our thoughts are onely euill, and that continually. Gen. 6. 5 <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 5.</note> We are not able ſo much as to will that which is good Phil. <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 13.</note> 2. 13. And inſtead of being reſtrained by Gods Law from ſinne, it taketh occaſion by the commaundement, to worke in vs all manner of concupiſcence. Rom. 7. 8. But it is onely <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 8.</note> Gods Euangelicall and ſpirituall word, whereby we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from ſin, and enabled to performe obedience; when as the ſpirit giueth life and power to the dead and weake letter, &amp; by the ſecret operation thereof, maketh it effectuall for the working of that grace in vs, which it requireth, and to the ſtirring of vs vp to performe that duty which it enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. Iohn. 6. 63. <note place="margin">Iohn. 6. 63.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The vſe which we are to make hereof is: firſt, that wee yeeld vnto the Lord the whole praiſe of our obedience, and of reſtrayning vs from committing thoſe ſinnes into which we ſee others f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l, for he alone maketh the difference between vs and them. Secondly, that we doe not preſumptuouſly truſt in our owne ſtrength, thinking that wee are able to ſtand when others fall: but let vs <hi>worke out our ſaluation with feare and trembling, and whileſt we think we ſtand, let vs take heede of a fall.</hi> As the Apoſtle exhorteth. Phil. 2. 12. 1 Cor. 10. 12. And wholy diſtruſting in our owne ſtrength, let vs ſolye reſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:10737:181"/> vpon <hi>the Lord, and the power of his might.</hi> Eph. 6. 10. And <note place="margin">Ephe. 6. 10.</note> to this end let vs remember the example of <hi>Peter,</hi> Mat. 26 <note place="margin">Mat. 66. 33. 74.</note> 33. 74. And thinke with our ſelues, that if this rock were ſhaken with the tempeſt of tentation, that we who in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon are but reedes, cannot ſtand ſteady in our owne ſtrength. Laſtly, conſidering that Gods powerfull word and ſpirit vpholdeth vs from falling into ſinne, we learne conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to craue the Lords aſsiſtance, and to make that praier which Chriſt hath taught vs: <hi>O Lord lead vs not into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but deliuer vs from euill,</hi> and then ſhall we finde the Lord true of his promiſe. 1. Cor. 10. 13. <hi>For he knoweth how</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>to deliuer the godly out of tentation, &amp;c.</hi> 2. Pet. 2. 9. <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 9.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, wee may obſerue how the Lord mingleth Mercy with Iudgement, and euen in his corrections ſheweth his <note place="margin">God mingleth Mercie with Iudgement.</note> fatherly loue and compaſsion: he will not preſently receiue them to mercy, but yet he doth not exclude them from it for euer, hee correcteth them for a time, but leaſt they ſhould faint, he promiſeth an end to their afflictions; hee reſtraines his fauour and as it were baniſheth them his preſence, not that hee intendeth vtterly to reject them, but that they may be moued hereby more ſoundly and ſeriouſly to repent; hee diuorceth them from him, but in the meane while he reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth himſelfe for them, and waiteth for their repentance that hee may reſtore them into his former fauour. How infinite therefore are Gods mercies, ſeeing his judgements are ſo full of compaſsion? how ſweet and comfortable is his loue, bountie and goodneſſe, ſeeing the actions of his anger and juſtice are not without the mixture of ſuch comfortable ſweetneſſe? and if he be ſo gracious when he puniſheth, how gracious will he appeare when he rewardeth? Many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples hereof wee haue in the booke of God: when hee caſt <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe, he giueth him hope to inherite hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> and when he threatneth him with labour and ſorrow, he promiſeth him a Sauiour, in whom he ſhould haue joy and eternall reſt. When he threatneth captiuitie to the poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> he limiteth the time, which being expired he <note place="margin">Gen. 15. 13. 14</note> promiſeth deliueraunce. Hee denounceth againſt <hi>Dauid</hi>

Hee layeth vpon <hi>Leui</hi> a curſe, that hee ſhould be ſcattered amongſt his people. as though he were not a Tribe, and had no portion amongſt his brethren. Gen. 49. 7. but in this <note place="margin">Gen. 49. 7.</note> curſe was included a bleſsing, for he therefore ſcattered them that he might gather them vnto himſelfe, and depriued them of other portions, that hee himſelfe might be their portion and reward. Deut. 10. 8, 9. He cauſed <hi>Manaſſes</hi> to be led <note place="margin">Deut. 10. 8. 9.</note> captiue, and to be bound in chaines, but his captiuity was to bee preferred before his libertie; his dungeon before his ſtately pallaces; and his chaines of iron, were better vnto him, then his chaines of gold and moſt rich ornaments; for <note place="margin">2 Chro. 33.</note> God vſed his Captiuitie, as a meanes to free him out of the captiuitie of ſinne and Sathan, his chaines to preſerue him from the chaines of darkneſſe, and his dungeon to keepe him from running head-long into the dungeon of hell,</p>

                  <hi>King, and without a Prince, and without an Offering, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Image, and without an Ephod, and without a Teraphim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where he ſheweth: firſt, who ſhall remaine in this eſtate of a mournfull widdow, namely, the children of Iſraell, by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:10737:182"/> which we are to vnderſtand the ten Tribes, who in the land of their Captiuitie, were without Prieſt or Magiſtrate; and not the people of Iuda, who had both: neyther yet is it to be vnderſtood of the whole body of the people, but onely of the elect Iſraelites: for they onely remayned for a time, without Ciuill or Eccleſiaſticall gouernement, and without publike meanes of worſhipping eyther the true God or Idols; for theſe they would not worſhip, nor communicate with the Gentiles in their Idolatries; and God they could not worſhip after that publike manner preſcribed in his word, ſeeing they were exiled from the Temple: vntill Chriſt came, who was their King, Prieſt and Prophet, which tooke away the difference of places, and reſtored vnto the conuerted Iſraelites, the publike meanes of ſeruing God: whereas the reprobate Iſraelites euer remained without the true worſhip of God, and not onely vnto a certaine time: and were not without Images and Idols, ſeeing they communicated with the heathen in their Idolatryes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he ſetteth downe the time, wherein they ſhould remaine in their widdowes eſtate, namely, for the ſpace of many dayes, that is, euen to the comming of their Meſsias Ieſus Chriſt: which from the ſixt yeare of <hi>Ezechias,</hi> wherein the Iſraelites were led captiue into Aſsiria by <hi>Salmanaſer,</hi> was 680. yeares.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he implyeth the ſorrow and mourning of the people, by this phraſe of ſitting; which vſually in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is aſcribed to thoſe, who are in griefe and heauineſſe: for not knowing which way to eaſe themſelues, nor hauing any appetite, when they are oppreſſed with ſorrow, to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any thing, they ſit down &amp; bewaile their miſerie. So it is ſaid of <hi>Iobs</hi> friends, that they <hi>ſate downe to mourne with him,</hi> when they could not help him. Iob. 2. 13. Of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> that <note place="margin">Iob. 2. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>he ſate downe and wept, and mourned for certaine dayes.</hi> Nehe. <note place="margin">Nehe. 1. 4.</note> 1. 4.

And Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon <note place="margin">Lamen. 1. 1. 2.</note> ſayeth of her ſelfe, that ſhee would <hi>not ſit as a Widdow.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſa. 47. 8.</note> Eſay. 47. 8.</p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:10737:182"/>
               <p> Fourthly, hee ſheweth wherein her widdow-hood con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth: namely, in being depriued of the outward ſignes of her communion with God, both in regard of Ciuill and Eccleſiaſticall gouernement, and of the meanes of Gods pure and publike worſhip: as alſo in being reſtrained from worſhipping and ſeruing Idols &amp; falſe Gods. All which are expreſſed in theſe particulars, <hi>Without a King, and without a Prince,</hi> that is, without any Magiſtrate of their owne nation, or any publike forme of gouernement, whereby Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is repreſented in the common wealth. <hi>And without an Offring:</hi> that is, they ſhould not offer Sacrifices and Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for neyther was it lawfull to erect an Altar, or offer a <note place="margin">Deut. 12. 13. 14.</note> Sacrifice any where, ſauing at Ieruſalem, the place appointed for Gods publike worſhip. <hi>And without an Image:</hi> namely, made to repreſent Gods preſence, ſuch as were the Images erected by <hi>Ieroboam</hi> in Dan and Bethell. 1 King. 12. 28, 29. <note place="margin">1 King. 12. 28.</note> and thoſe ſpoken of 2 King. 17. 10. <hi>And without an Ephod:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 King. 17. 10.</note> of which there were two kinds: the one made of Gold, blew Silke, Purple, Scarlet, and twined Linnen: in which were the two Onix ſtones, wherein were graued the name of the twelue Tribes, and the Vrim and the Thummin; and this was proper to the high Prieſt, of which we may read. Exod. <note place="margin">Exod. 28. 6.</note> 28. 6. &amp;c. The other made of Linnen, of which wee may read. 1 Sam. 2. 18. 2 Sam. 6. 14. The meaning is, that they <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 28.</note> ſhould bee without a Prieſt-hood, which ſhould inſtruct <note place="margin">2 Sam. 6. 14.</note> them, and aske counſell for them of the Lord. Laſtly, hee ſaith, that they ſhould be <hi>without a Teraphim:</hi> that is, they ſhould haue nothing to doe, with the Idoll Gods of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then: for the Teraphims were Images which the Idolatrous Heathens worſhipped, of which kinde were thoſe Tera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims or Images, which <hi>Rachell</hi> ſtole from her Idolatrous father <hi>Laban.</hi> Gen. 31. 19. and that Teraphim in <hi>Michaes</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 31. 19.</note> houſe. Iudg. 17. 5. <note place="margin">Iudg. 17. 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>So that hereby it appeareth, in what the widdow-hood of the Church of Iſraell conſiſted; namely, that ſhe ſhould haue no ſigne of Gods preſence, in the ciuell gouernment, for ſhe ſhould haue no King nor Magiſtrate; nor yet in the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:10737:183"/> Church, for ſhe ſhould haue no offring, nor Ephod, that is, no Prieſthood, nor publike meanes of worſhipping God, according to his word. Neither yet ſhould ſhee follow her louers, and commit Idolatrie with them; for ſhe ſhould not worſhip the true God after a falſe manner, as <hi>Ieroboam</hi> did in images; nor the heathen idols, for ſhe ſhould be without a Teraphim.</p>
               <p>Now the Lords end in all this was, that he might weane the elect Iſraelites from their vaine hopes, by withdrawing from them all thoſe things wherein they truſted, that ſo ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no other hope of being deliuered out of their miſerie, they might turne to the Lord by true repentance, and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from him alone freedome from their afflictions. For as long as they had any Kings and gouernment, or any forme of a common wealth, whileſt they had any ſhew of Religion, or any outward meanes of worſhipping God, though they were neuer ſo much depraued and corrupted, they reſted, nay they boaſted in it, as though they were in good eſtate: and therefore to beate them from this vaine conceipt, the Lord threatneth to bring vpon them a confuſed anarchie, &amp; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue them of all ſhew &amp; outward appearance of a Church, that ſo being humbled in the ſight and ſenſe hereof, they might be moued laying aſide all other hopes, to expect ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation in Ieſus Chriſt, and be the better fitted to receiue him when he was exhibited, as their onely King, Prieſt, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and Redeemer.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of the words: from whence we <note place="margin">That the beames of Gods fauour are often clouded with afflictions.</note> may obſerue theſe inſtructions. Firſt, whereas he ſaith that the people of Iſrael ſhal ſit waiting in heauines, without any outward ſignes of gods comfortable preſence; hence we learn that euen Gods deareſt children oftentimes haue the beames of Gods fauour ſo clouded from them in their afflictions, that they ſeeme vnto themſelues deſolate, and vtterly forſaken of God, as appeareth in this place. So <hi>Iob</hi> complayneth, Chap. <note place="margin">Iob. 13. 24.</note> 13. 24. <hi>Wherefore hydeſt thou thy face, and takeſt mee for thine enimie.</hi> And <hi>Dauid</hi> Pſal. 13. 1. <hi>How long wilt thou forget mee O Lord, for euer? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me?</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 13. 1.</note>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:10737:183"/> And 88. 14. <hi>Lord why doeſt thou reiect my ſoule, and hideſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 88. 14. and 46. 89.</note> 
                  <hi>thy face from me?</hi> 89. 46. So <hi>Eſay</hi> complaineth in the name of the faithfull, Chapter 45. 15. <hi>Verely thou O God hideſt thy</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſa. 45. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>ſelfe.</hi> The Church likewiſe, Lamen. 5. 20. <hi>Wherefore doeſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Lamen. 5. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>thou forget vs for euer, and forſake vs ſo long time?</hi> Yea this was the complaint of the ſonne of God himſelfe, when as he bore our iniquities, Math. 27. 46. Not that indeede the Lord <note place="margin">Math. 27. 46.</note> doth euer forſake thoſe whom he hath once choſen, but onely for a time with-houldeth the outward ſignes and inward fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his comfortable preſence, that hee may moue them more ſeriouſly to ſorrow for ſinne, more earneſtly to beg and pray for the returne of his fauour, and more preciouſly to eſteeme of it being reſtored vnto them, when they perceiue how barraine of all comfort and ioy their ſoules are, as ſoone as the Sun-ſhine of Gods fauour is ecclipſed from them.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is, that if euer the Lord ſeeme thus to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himſelfe from vs in our afflictions, wee be ſo humbled hereby, as that in the meane time we ſincke not into deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as though we were vtterly rejected: and to this end let vs remember that this hath beene the lot of the deareſt of Gods children; and therefore let this comfort vs, that the ſame <hi>afflictions haue beene accompliſhed in other of the faithfull.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 13. 1 Pet. 5. 9.</note> Secondly let vs call to mind times of old, wherein the Lord gaue vs ſure teſtimonies of his loue, and ſo from the immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilitie of his loue, mercy and goodneſſe, wee may receiue comfort. So <hi>Dauid.</hi> Pſal. 77. 11. <note place="margin">Pſal. 77. 11.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, we may obſerue how the Church behaueth her ſelfe when ſhee ſeemeth left and forſaken of God, namely, ſhe ſits downe like a deſolate widdow, and ſpendeth her time <note place="margin">That we muſt not be careleſſe and ſenceleſſe in the time of affliction.</note> in mourning and lamentation: whence we learne not to make light of this heauie affliction, nor to walk vnder this waighty burthen, with ſtiffe and ſtretched out necks: but when God in the time of affliction ſeemeth to eſtrange and abſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, we muſt humble our ſoules with mourning and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, watch and waite for his returne, and continually cry and call vpon him by hearty prayer, deſiring nothing in the world ſo much, as that hee will haſten his comming, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:10737:184"/> re-aſſure vs of his fauour. And if we thus behaue our ſelues, then ſhall we finde Gods promiſe verified. Eſa. 54. 8. <hi>For a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſay. 54. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>little while haue I forſaken thee, but with great compaſſion will I gather thee.</hi> And by this meanes alſo, ſhall we gather vnto our ſelues aſſurance, that we are indeed eſpouſed vnto God, when as the Lord our husband, hauing abſented himſelfe in ſome diſpleaſure, we doe not like ſtrumpets rejoyce in his abſence; or if there be any little griefe, ſeeke to put it off by haunting the company of vaine perſons, and by paſsing the time in ſports and paſtimes: but like loyall and louing wiues bewayle his abſence and diſpleaſure, taking delight in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, till wee enjoy his loue againe, in whom our ſoule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth.</p>
               <p>Here therefore two extreames are to be auoyded: for as we muſt not ſincke and fall downe flat vnder the burthen of Gods diſpleaſure: ſo we muſt not ſtand vpright with ſtiffe and ſtretched out necks, caſting it aſide without care or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but we muſt take the middle courſe, that is, we muſt ſtoupe and buckle vnder our burthen, as being weary of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, we muſt ſit downe and mourne like a widdow, forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and deſolate, delighting in nothing till wee feele and finde that God deligheth in vs, and is reconciled vnto vs. An example hereof we haue in the Church. Pſal. 137. 2. 3. <note place="margin">Pſal. 237. 2. 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, we are to obſerue Gods wiſe mixture of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Iudgement, that the Church might neyther be ſecure <note place="margin">Gods wiſe mixture of Mercy and Iudgement.</note> and careleſſe, nor yet comfortleſſe and without hope: for whereas he ſaith, that ſhe ſhall ſit mourning for many dayes, herein is implyed, that her afflictions ſhould neyther bee ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhort, nor very long. Firſt, hee ſheweth that they ſhould not be very ſhort, for they ſhould laſt for many dayes: and then that they ſhould not be very long, for they ſhould not laſt for many ages, or many yeares, but onely for many dayes. He doth not reckon the time by minutes or houres, for then they would haue beene ſecure and wretchleſſe, and ſo taking no care to arme themſelues with patience, they would haue beene altogether vnprepared, when contrary to their hope their afflictions were tediouſly continued; nor yet by yeares
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:10737:184"/> or ages, leaſt whileſt he ſought to arme them with patience, he ſhould diſarme them of hope, vvhich is our chiefe ſtay to keepe vs from ſincking vnder affliction.</p>
               <p>The vſe which we are to make hereof is, that vvhen vvee are in affliction, vve doe neither expect preſent deliuerance, nor yet imagine that God will forſake vs for euer. For if our hopes be fruſtrate vve ſhall grow impatient, and if vve haue no hope at all we ſhall grow deſperate.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, vve may obſerue, that he ſaith the Iſraelits ſhould <note place="margin">That our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are momentanie howſoeuer they ſeeme te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to the fleſh.</note> continue in their afflicted eſtate many dayes, vvhereas in truth they continued diuers ages, euen ſixe hundred &amp; foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore yeeres. So hee ſaith that the Church of the Smirnians ſhould haue <hi>tribulation for ten dayes.</hi> Apoc. 2. 10. And that the Church ſhould be fed in the vvilderneſſe of affliction a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore dayes. Chap. 11. 6. By vvhich computation hee teacheth vs how vve are to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of the time of affliction; namely, howſoeuer to the fleſh it ſeeme long and tedious, yet it is to be judged ſhort &amp; momentanie, in compariſon of that eternall glory vvhich attendeth for vs, after vve haue finiſhed the ſhort skirmiſh of afflictions. When as therefore our troubles and croſſes, ſeeme ſo tedious, as though they would neuer end; let vs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort our ſelues with this conſideration, that they are in truth but light, ſhort and momentanie, in reſpect of that ſuperex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and eternall waight of glorie, which is reſerued for vs. 2 Cor. 4. 17. <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 17.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, whereas the Lord deſcribing the widdowhood of the Church of Iſraell, and the ſeperation betweene him and her, doth after-wards expound himſelfe, and ſheweth that it conſiſteth in the taking away of their King, Magiſtrates &amp; <note place="margin">The Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie ſignes of gods preſence.</note> ciuill gouernment, and the meanes of his publicke worſhip and ſeruice: hence wee learne, that Princes wiſely ruling in the common wealth, and godly and faithfull Miniſters pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly executing their functions, which concerne gods pure and ſincere worſhip in the Church, are notable ſignes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting vnto vs Gods owne preſence. So that where the Lord hath eſtabliſhed a lawfull and vviſe Magiſtracie, and a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:10737:185"/> godly, learned and faithful Miniſterie, there himſelfe is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ioyned in a neere communion with that church &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; where theſe are wanting, from thence the Lord may be ſaid to haue withdrawne himſelfe and to haue made a ſeperation, leauing ſuch a people in the eſtate of an afflicted vviddow. And this appeareth not onely in this, but alſo in diuers other places of ſcripture. For firſt for Kings and Magiſtrates, they are ſaid to be breathing and mortall <hi>gods, and the children of the moſt high,</hi> vvho in their gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after a more peculiar manner reſemble their heauenly father, Pſal. 82. 6. 7. In vvhoſe aſſemblies God ſtandeth and <note place="margin">Pſal. 82. 6. 7.</note> judgeth righteous judgement, ver. 1. <hi>God ſtandeth in the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie of gods, he iudgeth among gods.</hi> And for the miniſtery, and publicke ſeruice of God, vvee haue Chriſts promiſe, <hi>That where two or three are gathered together in his name, there is hee in the middeſt of them</hi> Mat. 18. 20. And howſoeuer <note place="margin">Mat. 18. 20.</note> being infinite he filleth heauen and earth vvith his preſence, yet after a more peculiar manner, he <hi>walketh in the middeſt of the ſeauen golden candleſtickes.</hi> Apoc. 1. 13. that is, he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in his Church to rule, defend and preſerue it. And hence it is, that vvhen <hi>Dauid</hi> vvas baniſhed from the Temple, and debarred of the publike meanes of Gods worſhip, hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playneth that he vvas baniſhed from Gods preſence, and caſt <note place="margin">Pſal. 42. 2. and 84. 1. 2.</note> out of his ſight. Pſal. 42. 2. and 84. 1. 2.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is: firſt, that vve highly valew and eſteeme theſe outward ſignes of Gods preſence; namely, a ciuill and <note place="margin">That the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracie and miniſterie are highly to be eſteemed.</note> peaceable gouernment in the common-wealth, vnder a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Prince, and a faithfull and painefull miniſtrie in the Church, by vvhoſe meanes vve injoy the publike vvorſhip &amp; ſeruice of God. For vvhileſt both theſe are ſetled amongſt vs, vve haue aſſured teſtimonies that God hath joyned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto vs in a neere communion. And on the other ſide, when theſe for our ſinnes are taken away, then doth the Lord hide his face from vs, and maketh a viſible ſeperation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs and him. The conſideration vvhereof ſhould make vs rejoyce, and magnifie the name of the Lord, vvhen vve injoy theſe vnualuable bleſsings; and to ſit downe and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:10737:185"/> mourne like a deſolate vviddow, vvhen vve are depriued of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this ſerueth for the reproofe, firſt of Popiſh <note place="margin">Popiſh traitors reprooued.</note> Traytors who are euer plotting and contriuing the death of Chriſtian Princes, and continually labour to diſturbe and ouerthrow all peaceable and vvell ſetled gouernment, that ſo bringing in all diſorder and confuſion, they may haue better opportunitie of fiſhing in theſe troubled waters. For what doe they elſe herein, but euen offer violence vnto Gods own perſon, when as they hurt Princes, whom he hath placed, as his liuely Images, to repreſent his preſence in the common wealth? What doe they elſe, but as much as in them lyeth, ſeuer that communion which is betweene God and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and bring their country into the mournefull eſtate of an afflicted Widdow. How farre are theſe from the precept of the Apoſtles. Rom. 13. 1. 5. 1 Pet. 2. 13. 17. And from the <note place="margin">Rom. 13. 1, 5. 1 Pet. 2. 13. 17.</note> practiſe of <hi>Dauid,</hi> whoſe heart throbbed becauſe he had but cut the garment of the Lords annoynted, though hee were already rejected of God, and himſelfe choſen to his place. <note place="margin">2 Sam. 24. 6.</note> 2 Sam. 24. 6.</p>

                  <hi>children of Iſraell conuert &amp; ſeeke the Lord their God, and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid their King, and ſhall feare the Lord, and his goodneſſe in the latter dayes.</hi> In which words is ſet downe the conuerſion of the people of Iſraell, and the time thereof. Their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion it ſelfe is firſt expreſſed, and then a two-fold effect thereof: their conuerſion in theſe words, <hi>Afterwards ſhall the people of Iſraell conuert,</hi> or rather, <hi>ſhall be conuerted.</hi> The which words haue relation to their former afflictions, as though he ſhould ſay, after they haue beene long exerciſed with grieuous afflictions, at length the Lord will ſo ſanctifie them to their vſe, as that hereby they ſhall be truely humbled, conuerted, and brought to vnfained repentance. The which promiſe tended to the ſingular comfort of the afflicted Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites, when as being almoſt ouerwhelmed with miſeries, they were aſſured not onely that at length they ſhould haue an end, but alſo that they ſhould bring forth this notable fruit of their true conuerſion.</p>
               <p>The effects of their conuerſion are ſhewed in the words following: firſt, <hi>That they ſhall ſeeke the Lord their God and Dauid their king.</hi> Where, by this phraſe of ſeeking the Lord, we are to vnderſtand, that hauing bewailed their former apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy, and forſaken their ſinnes by true Repentance, they ſhould labour to be reconciled vnto God in Chriſt, worſhip and ſerue him according to his Word, inuocate his Name, make profeſsion of his true Religion, and imbrace the true <hi>Iehouah</hi> as their onely God, by a liuely faith. And this large ſignification hath this phraſe of ſeeking the Lord, not onely here, but alſo elſe where. So Pſal. 24. 6. and 27. 8. Eſay. 55. 6. <note place="margin">Pſal. 24. 6. and 27. 8. Eſay. 55. 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is further added: <hi>And Dauid their King.</hi> In which words are implyed two things: Firſt, that the Iſraelites had formerly made a defection from the kingdome of <hi>Dauid:</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:10737:186"/> namely, vnder the raigne of <hi>Rehoboam.</hi> 1 King. 12. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <note place="margin">1 Kings. 12.</note> that now they ſhould make vp this breach, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjoyning themſelues as obedient ſubiects to this kingdome. Where by <hi>Dauid</hi> we are not to vnderſtand the ſonne of <hi>Iſhai,</hi> who was long agoe dead: but our Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, who vſually in the Prophets was called <hi>Dauid,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth. Ezech. 34. 23. 24. <hi>And I will ſet vp a Shepheard ouer</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ezech. 34. 23. and 37. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>them, and he ſhall feed them, euen my ſeruant Dauid.</hi> And 37. 24. <hi>Dauid my ſeruant ſhall be king ouer them, &amp;c.</hi> Ier. 30. 9 <note place="margin">Ieremie. 30. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>They ſhall ſerue the Lord their God and Dauid their king.</hi> The reaſon hereof is: firſt, becauſe <hi>Dauid</hi> was a Type of Chriſt: ſecondly, becauſe he came out of his loynes, and in this reſpect is vſually called the ſonne of <hi>Dauid:</hi> thirdly, becauſe the promiſe made to <hi>Dauid,</hi> concerning the eternitie of his kingdom, was knowne commonly to all the people, of which they are here put in minde, for the better ſtrengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their faith.</p>
               <p>So that by ſeeking the Lord and <hi>Dauid</hi> their king, is meant, that they ſhould know and acknowledge, worſhip and ſerue, both God the father, and his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt: according to that, Iohn. 17. 3. <hi>This is life eternall, that they</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 17. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>know thee, the onely very God and whom thou haſt ſent Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> For as when they were ſaid to haue made a defection from <hi>Dauid,</hi> the meaning was not that this defection vvas made from his perſon, ſeeing hee was dead many yeeres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; but from his kingdome eſtabliſhed in his poſteritie: ſo when they are here ſaid to ſeeke <hi>Dauid</hi> their king, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that they ſhould not ſeeke his perſon which was dead, but his kingdome eſtabliſhed for euer in his ſeed Ieſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond effect of their conuerſion is expreſſed in theſe <note place="margin">Morrall.</note> words: <hi>And ſhall feare the Lord and his goodnes,</hi> or as the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew hath it, <hi>ſhall feare vnto the Lord.</hi> Wherby we are not to vnderſtand that they ſhould performe that morral dutie of fearing God, as our Engliſh tranſlation ſeemeth to import: but that they ſhould fearefully haſten vnto the Lord and his goodneſſe, that is, being affrighted with the ſight and ſence
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:10737:187"/> of their ſinnes, the curſe of the law, the anger of God, death, and damnation due vnto them, they ſhall with all poſsible ſpeede flye vnto the Lord, &amp; to his goodnes, and by a liuely faith lay hold vpon gods mercie offred vnto them in Chriſt, and reſt vvholy therevpon for their ſaluation, So that this ſeemeth to be a Metaphor taken from Birds, which being ſodainely feared doe fearefully flye vnto their retiring places of greateſt ſafety. And thus this word is taken, Chap. 11. 11. <note place="margin">Hoſea. 11. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>They ſhall feare as a ſparrow out of Aegipt,</hi> that is, being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted they ſhall flye with great haſt. And in this ſence the Latine vvord <hi>trepidare</hi> is vſed, as Liuij annalium 23. <hi>Mox<expan>

               </p>
               <p>And the rather doe I thus expound the vvords: firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is an vnproper manner of ſpeach to expreſſe the morrall dutie of fearing God, by this phraſe of fearing vnto God. Secondly, vve are not ſaid to feare Gods goodneſſe, but rather his juſtice and judgements. True it is that God is feared for his goodneſſe, according to that, Pſal. 130. 4. <note place="margin">Pſal. 130. 4.</note> namely, as a gracious father, whom for his goodneſſe towards vs we are loath to diſpleaſe, but his goodneſſe it ſelfe is not fearefull or terrible, but ſweet and comfortable. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the vvord is ſo taken in other places.</p>
               <p>The meaning therefore of theſe vvords, is briefely thus much, that the people of Iſraell being terrified and affrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ſight and ſenſe of their ſinnes, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments due vnto them, ſhould flye ſpeedily vnto the Lord, as being their protector &amp; ſure defence, comforting themſelues in the aſſured hope of his grace and goodneſſe; vvhereby they ſhould bee aſſured that their ſinnes ſhall bee forgiuen them, and they freed from them both in reſpect of their guilt and puniſhment.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the effects of their conuerſion. The time is expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>in the latter or laſt dayes:</hi> that is, after that Ieſus Chriſt the true Meſsias is exhibited in the fleſh, which vſually in the Scriptures is called the laſt dayes.
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:10737:187"/> Deut. 4. 30. Eſa. 2. 2. Micha. 4. 1. Heb. 1. 1. 1 Pet. 1. 20. 1 Iohn. 2. 28. The which time is ſpecified. Firſt, to ſhew their obſtinacy in their ſinnes and corruptions, ſeeing theſe tough humours could no otherwiſe be purged away, but by the long working potions of tedious and bitter afflictions. Secondly, that they might prepare themſelues patiently to beare theſe miſeries, thus tediouſly continued, when as they were forwarned of them, for <hi>praemonitus praemunitus.</hi> Thirdly, that they might hereby bee refreſhed with ſome comfort, when as they were aſſured that howſoeuer their troubles were tedious yet at length they ſhould haue a happie end, ſeeing they ſhould bring them vnto God by true repentance and a liuely faith.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of the words: the inſtructions <note place="margin">God ſanctifieth the afflictions of his Elect for their conuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> which from hence ariſe are many: firſt, wee here obſerue, how the Lord ſanctifieth the afflictions of the Elect for their conuerſion and true repentance, for after that the people are grieuouſly afflicted, at the length they are humbled in the ſight of their ſinnes, and turne vnto the Lord. The like examples wee haue in <hi>Dauid;</hi> the Iſraelites in the Iudges time; <hi>Manaſſes;</hi> the prodigall Sonne; and many others, and this is that which the Prophet ſpeaketh, Eſay. 26. 16. <hi>O Lord</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſay. 26. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>in trouble they haue viſited thee, they haue poured forth a prayer when thy chaſtening was vpon them.</hi> So that affliction humbleth them whom proſperitie puffeth vp with Pride, it ſoftneth thoſe whom proſperitie hardened, it conuerteth into the wayes of righteouſneſſe, thoſe whom proſperitie made to wander into the by-pathes of ſinne. But yet they worke not theſe good effects in all, but onely in thoſe, vnto whoſe vſe they are ſanctified by Gods ſpirit, as we may ſee in example of <hi>Pharaoh, Saul, Ieroboam, &amp;c.</hi> who the more they were hammered and beaten vpon with afflictions, the more hard and obdurate they waxed.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof, ſerueth to comfort all the faithfull in their greateſt troubles and miſeries, ſeeing they may bee aſſured that the Lord vvill ſanctifie their afflictions for their humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, conuerſion &amp; ſaluation. For wel may we be contented
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:10737:188"/> to be beaten, that wee may bee betred; to bee put into the furnace of affliction, that being purged from the droſſe of our corruptions, wee may like pure gold be treaſured vp in the treaſury of eternall happineſſe: to be pruned, that wee may become more fruitfull: to be hammered, that our hard hearts may be made contrite, and not onely with patience, but alſo with joy, and loue may we kiſſe that rod, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs to run vnto God for mercy and forgiueneſſe.</p>
               <p>But foraſmuch as the tree of affliction bringeth forth no ſuch fruits, vnleſſe it be vvatered vvith the ſweet dew of gods ſpirit: therefore let vs alſo make this vſe hereof, that when we are afflicted, we earneſtly pray vnto God, that hee will ſanctifie our miſeries to our vſe and benefit: and out of this poyſon, gather for our good, this ſweet hony of humiliation and obedience: that is, that our pouerty may turne to our ſpirituall inriching with the gifts of his ſpirit, that our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble may tend to eternall reſt, our ſhame to glory, our ſence of paine, to the encreaſe of our ſence of ſinne, and that <hi>our light and momentanie afflictions may cauſe vnto vs a ſuperexcellent</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>and eternall waight of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, we learne that the Elect in their afflictions go directly vnto the Lord, by his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt, that they may be reconciled vnto him, and be receiued into grace, and not vnto Saints and Angels, as it is the cuſtome of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, who when they are in any daunger or trouble make their prayers and vowes vnto the Virgin <hi>Mary, Peter</hi> and other Saints.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wheras he ſaith, that they ſhall ſeeke <hi>Iehouah</hi> and <note place="margin">Chriſt is true God coequall with his father.</note> 
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> their king, that is, Ieſus Chriſt: here we obſerue that the ſame diuine worſhip is aſcribed vnto Chriſt, which alſo is attributed vnto God; and conſequently he is not meere man, but God coequall with his father, for vnto God alone belongeth diuine worſhip, and this Chriſt chalengeth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. Iohn. 5. 22. 23. Where he ſheweth, that <hi>the father hath</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iohn. 5. 22. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>committed all Iudgement vnto the Sonne, that all men might honour the Sonne, as they honour the Father.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Chriſt true man.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, we hence gather that he is not God alone, but
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:10737:188"/> man alſo, for as this diuine vvorſhip yeelded vnto him prooueth him to be God, ſo his name <hi>Dauid</hi> implyeth that he is man, deſcended of <hi>Dauids</hi> poſteritie.</p>
               <p>Againe, from the conjunction of theſe two, ſeeking God and <hi>Dauid;</hi> vve gather that God is then alone vvorſhipped <note place="margin">God is to bee worſhipped in Chriſt.</note> aright, vvhen as he is worſhipped vvith his ſonne and in his ſonne. <hi>For in him alone the father is reconciled and well pleaſed.</hi> Mat. 3. 17. <hi>In him alone we are graciouſly accepted.</hi> Ephe. 1. 6. <note place="margin">Math. 3. 17. Eph. 1. 6.</note> In him he vvill be vvorſhipped and ſerued, and vvhoſoeuer vvorſhippeth not God the father in his ſonne Chriſt, they doe not vvorſhip the true <hi>Iehouah,</hi> but an idoll of their own framing, for vvhoſoeuer hath not the ſonne hath not the father. 1 Ioh. 2. 23. Becauſe howſoeuer they are diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed <note place="margin">1 Iohn. 2. 23.</note> in perſons, yet they are one in ſubſtance, of the ſelfe ſame nature coeſſentiall and coeternall.</p>
               <p>Where it appeareth that howſoeuer the Iewes and Turkes doe profeſſe that they worſhip God the Father, yet in truth they do nothing leſſe, ſeeing they neither know nor acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt as their onely Sauiour and redeemer.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, whereas he calleth Chriſt by the name of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">The Royall dignitie of the faithfull.</note> vve may here obſerue the great and royall dignitie of the faithfull, in that the Lord vouchſafeth to call himſelfe by their name, and to call them after his name. Becauſe <hi>Dauid</hi> faithfully ſerued him in his life, therefore he honoureth him after his death, reuiuing his memory and eternizing his name by taking it vpon himſelfe; and ſo becauſe vve profeſſe his religion, and vvorſhip him though vvith much vveakeneſſe and imperfection, he vouchſafeth vs this dignitie, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his owne name vvee ſhould bee called Chriſtians. Thus hee honoured the Patriarkes, <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <note place="margin">Exod. 3. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>Iacob.</hi> Exod. 3. 15. And his people Iſraell, in that though he vvere the God of the whole Earth, yet he vvould be called after a peculiar manner the God of Iſraell.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is, that vve zealouſly ſerue the Lord, and <note place="margin">If we honour God hee will honour vs.</note> ſeeke his glory, in honour and diſhonour, euill report and good report, not fearing any vvhit at all that we ſhall be
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:10737:189"/> reproched, haue our names traduced, and looſe that reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which we haue in the world, by being ouer forward and preciſe in performing the duties of Gods worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice; for let vs aſſure our ſelues, that whileſt by our Godly conuerſation we honour God, hee will not onely cauſe vs to be honoured in our liues, but euen after our death our names ſhall liue, and be kept vpon record in the honourable roule of his holy Seruants, and bee calendred amongſt the Saints. Whereas on the other ſide, the name of the wicked, though it be neuer ſo glorious in their liues, yet ſhall it be ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their death, and putrifie in the ayre as faſt as their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes in the earth, as the wiſe man ſheweth. Prou. 10. 7. <hi>The</hi>

                  <hi>memoriall of the iuſt ſhall be bleſſed, but the name of the wicked ſhall rot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, we may obſerue, that when the people of Iſraell, <note place="margin">That we neuer flie to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee are throughly humbled.</note> are affrighted and terrified with the ſight and ſence of their ſinnes, and thoſe miſeries which doe accompany them, they doe then, and not before, flye vnto the Lord for grace and mercy: in whoſe example wee haue a notable preſident of our owne diſpoſition and practiſe; whileſt wee continue in our carnall ſecuritie and hardneſſe of heart, we neuer deſire mercy and forgiueneſſe; whileſt we thinke our ſelues whole and ſound, wee neuer ſeeke to our heauenly Phyſition, to be cured of our ſpirituall Leproſie and ſickneſſe of ſinne; whileſt we thinke our ſelues rich, and haue no ſence of our pouerty and nakedneſſe, we neuer labour after the riches of Gods mercy and Chriſts merits, nor to be clothed with the glorious garment of his innocency and obedience; whileſt we haue no ſence of our owne vnrighteouſneſſe, wee will neuer hunger after Chriſts righteouſneſſe; whileſt wee thinke our ſelues already highly in gods fauour, we neuer ſeeke to Chriſt our Mediator, to reconcile vs vnto his father: but when our hearts are broken &amp; contrite, &amp; our conſciences wounded, then doe wee earneſtly deſire the oyle of Gods mercy, and the precious baulme of Chriſts bloud, that thereby we may be cured; when we ſee our owne pouertie, we labour after the riches of his merits, and in a word, when we are terrified
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:10737:189"/> with the ſight and ſence of ſinne, and labour vnder it as a heauie burthen, then doe we flye vnto the Lord for comfort, and ſue vnto Ieſus Chriſt, that according to his gracious promiſe, hee will eaſe and releaſe vs. Of the former we haue <note place="margin">Math. 19. 16. 20. Luk. 18. 11. 14. Iob. 41. 6. Luk. 15. and 18. Acts. 2. 37.</note> examples in the young Iuſticiarie. Mat. 19. 16. 20. The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſie. Luke. 18. 11. 14. And in the Pharaſaycall Papiſts. Of the latter in <hi>Iob,</hi> Chap. 41. 6. In <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſal. 51. In the prodigall ſonne. Luke. 15. In the poore Publican. Luke. 18. And in the Iewes. Act. 2. 37.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, we may obſerue, that howſoeuer the Elect are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted <note place="margin">Son-like feare maketh vs to draw neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</note> and terrified with the ſight and ſence of ſinne, and the apprehenſion of Gods diſpleaſure, yet this their feare doth not make them to flie Gods preſence, but moueth them with all poſsible ſpeede to haſt vnto him, and his goodneſſe: for they are not like vnto ſlaues, who hauing offended, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without any aſſurance of their maiſters loue, do for feare of the whip runne away; but like ingenious and well nurtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red children, who hauing by their faults diſpleaſed their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doe not flye his preſence, but rather runne vnto him, and fall downe at his feete, acknowledging their fault, promiſing amendement, and imploring pardon and forgiueneſſe. For howſoeuer the apprehenſion of his diſpleaſure greatly fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them, yet the perſwaſion of his loue moderateth their feare, and begetteth in them ſome hope of remiſsion and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. So that here wee haue a plaine difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <note place="margin">The difference betwene ſon-like and ſeruile feare.</note> the Son-like feare of the faithfull, and the deſperate and ſeruile horrour of the wicked: for that cauſeth them with awfull reuerence to flye vnto the Lord for mercy and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueneſſe, becauſe of the experience which they haue of his goodneſſe: and the other cauſeth the wicked to flye from God, by reaſon of the fearefull expectation which they haue of Gods juſt vengeance. Of the former wee haue examples in <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſal. 51. In <hi>Daniell,</hi> Chap. 9. 5. And in the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall <note place="margin">Pſal. 51.</note> ſonne. Luk. 15.

               </p>
               <p>Seauenthly, whereas he ſaith, that being affrighted with <note place="margin">Apo. 6. 16.</note> the ſight and ſence of ſinne, they ſhould haſt vnto Gods
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:10737:190"/> goodneſſe: here we learne what is our beſt place of refuge, <note place="margin">Gods mercy our beſt refuge to flee vnto.</note> when our ſinnes terrifie vs: namely, Gods free and vndeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued goodneſſe, for the ſhade of Gods mercy is our beſt ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when as wee are ſcorched with the heat of his wrath: and our beſt courſe when we are purſued by his Iuſtice, is to flye to the throne of his grace and goodnes for pardon and forgiueneſſe. When therefore our conſciences accuſe vs for ſinne, let vs not flye vnto our owne righteouſnes, merits, &amp; ſatisfactions, for whatſoeuer wee haue done it was but our <note place="margin">Luke. 17. 10.</note> duety, and no man diſchargeth one debt by paying another; nor yet to the merits of Saints, for they could merit nothing for themſelues, much leſſe for others; neyther haue we any proprietie vnto them, nor they ſufficiency to make ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the leaſt ſinne; but we muſt flye vnto Gods goodnes, and expect pardon onely through his free and vndeſerued mercy, and Chriſts all ſufficient merits. An Example hereof we haue in <hi>Dauid,</hi> who hauing ſinned, doth not ſeeke for pardon by pleading that he had beene in former times, a man according to Gods owne heart, or by promiſing to make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction by his future obedience, but diſclayming all opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of deſert, he onely relyeth himſelfe vpon Gods mercy.

               <p>Eightly, out of the time of the accompliſhing this promiſe, concerning the conuerſion and deliuerance of the afflicted <note place="margin">Long afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s often neceſſary for our humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</note> Iſraelits; namely, that it ſhould be after that they had a long time beene tryed with afflictions, and in the laſt dayes: hence we obſerue, firſt that ſuch is the obſtinacie and hardnes of hart, euen ſometimes of thoſe that belong to Gods election, that they had neede for their humiliation and conuerſion to be afflicted, not onely with grieuous but alſo long laſting miſeries. And therefore it is not alwayes expedient for vs to haue quicke deliuerance out of our afflictions, vnleſſe they haue wrought that good worke in vs, for which they were inflicted, that is, humiliation and vnfayned repentance: for it will little auaile vs to haue our ſoules, wounded with ſinne, once or twiſe dreſſed, if they bee ſo left before they bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cured, becauſe they will againe ranckle and become
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:10737:190"/> as dangerous as they were before; it will nothing profit vs to haue ben caſt into the fierie furnace of affliction, if pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently wee be taken out before wee be purged and purified from the droſſe of our corruptions.</p>
               <p>Secondly wee may obſerue, that howſoeuer the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">The Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth out of tedious afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> of gods elect, being tediouſly continued, doe ſeeme to threaten their vtter diſtruction, yet in the end the Lord will graunt deliuerance, &amp; cauſe them to further their conuerſion and ſaluation; it may be whileſt we deferre our repentance, the Lord will delay his helpe, as though hee had vtterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken vs, but wee may aſſure our ſelues, that though he bee long in comming to our ayde, yet at length hee will come and graunt vnto vs a good iſſue out of all our trialls. Examples hereof wee haue in the Iſraelits in the Aegyptian capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie; in Babilon, and Aſsiria; in the three Children; <hi>Daniell</hi> in the Lyons den, and many others.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Prophet hauing in the former Chapter <note place="margin">The argument.</note> teſtified and approued the loue of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the people of Iſraell, to the end that thoſe who were long to continue in a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous Captiuitie, might in the middeſt of their miſeries be ſupported with ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: doth now againe direct his ſpeach to the Iſraelites of his owne times, accuſing and conuincing all ſtates and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, of diuers grieuous and enormious ſinnes, which raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and ruled in the whole land; and withall intermixeth ſuch juſt and well deſerued puniſhments, as the Lord was purpoſed to inflict vpon them, vnleſſe they preuented them by their vnfained repentance. And leaſt the people of Iuda by following their practiſe, ſhould make themſelues ſubiect to the like miſeries, he admoniſheth them not to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with them in their ſinnes, that they might not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of their puniſhments.</p>
            <p>And this is the maine argument of this Chapter: the parts <note place="margin">The generall Analyſis of the Chapter.</note> thereof are two. The firſt is an accuſation or ſharp repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the people of Iſraell, for their manifold haynous ſinnes, from the firſt Verſe to the fifteenth. The ſecond is an admonition to the people of Iuda, to auoid their ſinnes, that they may eſcape their puniſhments; from the fifteenth
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:10737:191"/> Verſe, to the end of the Chapter. The firſt part is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a judiciall forme of proceeding, wherein the people of Iſrael are ſummoned to appeare, and arraigned before the Tribunall of Gods Iudgement, to anſwere ſuch things, as ſhould bee laid to their charge: namely, that they had by their capitall crimes and enormious ſinnes offended againſt their ſoueraigne Lord, the king of heauen and earth, and ſo breaking his Lawes, had made themſelues guiltie and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to thoſe puniſhments, which were therin threatned. All which their offences were comprized in foure ſeuerall bils of inditement, of which being conuicted, there is annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to euery bill a forme of condemnation, to ſuffer ſuch pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, as they had juſtly deſerued. The firſt bill of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement is contained Verſe. 1. and 2. the ſentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is affixed Verſe 3. The ſecond bill Verſe 4. the ſentence in the 5. The third bill and third ſentence are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixed, Verſe 6. 7. vnto the 11.

            <p>And theſe are the ſpeciall branches of this firſt generall <note place="margin">The maine ſcope of this Prophecie.</note> part. Now the generall ſcope of the Lord, in all this is, that the people who liued ſo ſecurely in their ſinnes, that they lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing regarded eyther the perſon of the Prophets, or their threatnings, might at leaſt be awakened out of their ſpirituall Lethargie, when as they heard themſelues ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned before Gods Iudgement Seate, and perceiued that the Lord would no longer ſuffer his word to be contemned in the mouth of his ſeruants, but would plead in his owne cauſe, and examine and try the tranſgreſſours of his lawes, before his owne Tribunall Seate of Iudgement, and ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the condemnation and execution of thoſe whom he found guiltie.</p>

               <p>Concerning the Firſt, we are firſt to note the context, and ſo come to ſhew the meaning of the words themſelues. In <note place="margin">The context.</note> the former chapter, the Lord vnder certaine types and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables, comforted thoſe Iſraelits which were to be afflicted, in a grieuous and tedious captiuitie, by aſſuring them of his loue, and that their miſeries were but the chaſtiſements of a louing father, for their good and conuerſion, and not the puniſhments of an enemie for their hurt and deſtruction. Now leſt the ſecure Iſraelits of his owne times, ſhould take encouragement vnto them, by the former doctrine of conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, to be moued thereby to continue in their impaeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; hee ſheweth that howſoeuer the Lord was purpoſed to be gracious vnto his elect Iſraelits in after ages, yet he would in the meane time puniſh ſeuerely thoſe haynous &amp; enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious ſinnes as raigned amongſt them, vnleſſe they preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his judgements by their vnfained repentance.</p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:10737:192"/>
               <p> And this is the context: now let vs come to the meaning <note place="margin">The peoples ſummons.</note> of the words. <hi>Heare the word of the Lord ye children of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell.</hi> Wherein the Prophet ſummoneth the people to appeare before the Lord, to anſwere vnto ſuch things, as ſhould bee <note place="margin">The expoſition</note> objected and laid to their charge. For as, judges, before they ſuffer any to be accuſed or condemned, doe cauſe their clarke or cryer to ſummon and call forth the partie, to ſee what hee can anſwere for himſelfe; ſo doth the Lord take the ſame iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall courſe with ſinners, for the approouing of his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgements; that is, hee citeth them before he accuſeth them, and accuſeth them before hee condemneth them. The which ſummons hee pronounceth ſometimes immediately by himſelfe, as when he cited <hi>Adam</hi> to appeare before him <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 9.</note> in Paradiſe, Gen. 3. 9. And thus hee ſummoneth men when as he ſpeaketh vnto their harts &amp; conſciences by his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and puniſhments: And ſometimes by his Miniſters, and that either men or Angels: by men as by his Prophets &amp; ambaſſadors, an example whereof we haue in this place: the like whereof we haue Eſa. 1. 18. Ier. 2. 4. 5. Mich. 1. 2. <note place="margin">Eſay. 1. 18. Iere. 2. 4. 5. Mich. 1. 2. and 6. 1. 2. 3.</note> and 6. 1. 2. 3. &amp;c. By Angels either in this life, when he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them his inſtruments and miniſters of his afflictions, judgements and puniſhments, or at the end of the world, when as the arch-Angell with the ſound of his trumpet, ſhall ſummon all men to appeare before the tribunall ſeate of Gods iudgement; of which we may read Math. 24. 31. <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 31. 1. Cor. 15 52. 1. Theſ. 4. 16. The drift of the ſummons.</note> 1 Cor. 15. 52. 1 Theſ. 4. 16.</p>
               <p>Now the maine drift of theſe ſummons is, to moue the people to heare with greater reuerence, care and conſcience, the reprehenſions and comminations which after follow: for howſoeuer they might haue ſome reaſon to neglect and contemne them, if they regarded the Prophets perſon and the meaneſſe of his qualitie &amp; condition, yet there was great cauſe why they ſhould heare them, not onely with reuerence but alſo with feare and trembling, if they conſidered that he was but a cryer, who ſummoned them in the name and at the appointment of the ſupreame judge of heauen &amp; earth; and but a meane ambaſſador, who deliuered vnto them not
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:10737:193"/> his owne words, but the ambaſſage of his glorious and moſt mighty king, from whom he is ſent.</p>
               <p>But let vs more ſpecially conſider of thoſe arguments <note place="margin">The arguments here vſed to moue attention</note> which are contained in theſe ſummons, proclaimed by the Lords Cryer, whereby he moueth them to receiue his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage with attention, feare and reuerence: The firſt is taken from the manner of his ſpeach, which is vſed when matters of great waight and importance follow, and therefore is not to be hearkened vnto negligently, or lightly to be regarded. The ſecond is taken from the perſon of him, from whom this meſſage is deliuered; namely, becauſe it is <hi>Iehouah</hi> that ſpeaketh vnto them, who created them, and continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued them, who is al-ſufficient to reward thoſe who harken vnto him, and almighty to puniſh thoſe who neglect his word: who had giuen vnto them many teſtimonies of his loue, and multiplyed vpon them all his benefits, aboue all other nations of the earth; who did not reprehend and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them for mallice to their perſons, or other ſiniſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, but that he might preſerue them from vtter deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they would repent and forſake their ſinnes, or glorifie his juſtice in their puniſhments, if by no meanes they would be reclaimed, but obſtinately perſiſt in their ſins, after they had ſo often warning. The third reaſon to moue them to heare and obey the voyce of the Lord ſummoning them by his Prophet, is taken from their owne perſons, to whom the meſſage is deliuered; in that they were the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, deſcended of the holy Patriarkes, choſen amongſt all other nations to be Gods peculiar Church and people, with whom God had made a couenant, and had on his part moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely performed it, preſeruing them from their enimies, and multiplying vpon them all his benefits.</p>
               <p>And this is the peoples ſummons, where by they who had <note place="margin">The contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie between the Lord and the people of Iſraell.</note> a long time neglected the word of the Lord in the mouth of his Prophets, were now cited to anſwere their contempt before the Tribunall ſeat of Gods Iudgement. Now follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the cauſe of this ſummons, which is, for the tryall of a controuerſie betweene the Lord and the people of Iſraell.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:10737:193"/> 
                  <hi>For the Lord hath a Controuerſie with the Inhabitants of the Land:</hi> Where firſt, we are to conſider the nature of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie, and ſecondly, the parties betweene whom it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerted. Gods controuerſies with a people are eyther ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball or reall: Verball, when as by his word, eyther immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately pronounced by himſelfe (as we may ſee in the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Cain)</hi> or by his Miniſters he reproueth, conuinceth, and condemneth a people for their ſinnes, and threatneth his Iudgements due vnto them: Reall, when as a people notwithſtanding Gods reprehenſions and threatnings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in their impenitencie haue deſerued puniſhments inflicted vpon them. Of both which kindes of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies this place may be vnderſtood, but yet principally as I take it, of the latter. For whereas the people had long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned Gods verball contentions, by the Prophets, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in their impenitency, without any amendement, the Lord now threatneth that he will contend with them after another manner: namely, by inflicting vpon them his reall Iudgements, ſeeing words would not preuaile with them.</p>
               <p>The like place to this we haue. Gen. 6. 3. <hi>Therefore the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord ſaid, my ſpirit ſhall not alwayes ſtriue with man, becauſe he is but fleſh, and his dayes ſhall be an hundred and twenty yeers:</hi> The meaning is, that becauſe the world was rooted in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate wickedneſſe, and would not be reclaimed by his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit preaching vnto them by righteous <hi>Noah,</hi> therefore hee would no longer contend with them in verbal controuerſies, ſeeing they were wholy carnall and corrupt: but would bring vpon them reall puniſhments, and that within the ſpace of an hundred and twenty yeeres, vnleſſe in the meane time, they preuented his Iudgements by turning from their ſinnes by true repentance. So here the Prophet telleth them, that becauſe Gods word was of no force with them for their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, the Lord would no longer thus ſtriue with them, and ſeeing his Prophets and their reprehenſions were deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, neglected, and contemned, therefore hee would take his owne cauſe into his owne hand, and contend no longer ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bally, but really with them, proceeding from words to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:10737:194"/> blowes, from threatnings to puniſhments.</p>
               <p>The parties betweene whom this debate is, are the Lord <note place="margin">The parties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene whom the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is.</note> and the people of Iſraell, which are here called the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the land; whereby he implyeth, Firſt that the Lord himſelfe was now become their aduerſarie, ſeeing there is no controuerſie or contention but betweene aduerſaries; as though hee ſhould ſay; the contention ſhall not be hereafter betweene you and the Prophets, becauſe ye contemne their perſons as weake and baſe men, and deride and neglect their admonitions, reprehenſions, and threatnings, as though they were falſe and rediculous; but betweene the Lord himſelfe and you, who is moſt wiſe to finde out your ſinnes, and moſt juſt to puniſh them. And this controuerſie ſhall be begun in the Court of Conſcience, before the Tribunall Seate of Gods Iudgement, where by the law which you haue tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed you ſhall be conuicted, and after ſhall be fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined when as hee ſhall inflict vpon you, ſuch reall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments as your ſinnes haue deſerued.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he hereby implyeth that the Iſraelites are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of enormious ſinnes, and grieuous tranſgreſsions, when as he ſaith, that the Lord hath a controuerſie with them; for ſuch is Gods exact juſtice, that he ſueth none, but ſuch as are indebted vnto him, neyther contendeth he with any, but onely ſuch as haue wronged and offended him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas he ſaith, that the Lord had this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie with the Inhabitants of the Land: hereby firſt he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinceth them of their breach of Couenant, which they had made with God; for howſoeuer the Lord had made good his promiſe, in driuing out the Canaanites, and giuing vnto them the Land in poſſeſsion: yet they had broken their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to God, violated their faith, forſaken Gods true Religion, and denied their obedience vnto his lawes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he aggrauateth their ſinnes and groſe ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in that after the Lord had caſt out the Canaanites, the auncient inhabitants of this country, for their Idolatry and other ſinnes, and giuen this land to the people of Iſraell for their poſſeſsion, that therein they might make profeſsion of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:10737:194"/> his true religion, and glorifie his name by worſhipping and ſeruing him according to his will; they neuertheleſſe neither remembring gods judgements inflicted vpon the Canaanits, nor his mercies multiplyed vpon themſelues, forſooke the couenant of their God, broke his lawes, committed idolatrie, and all other outragious ſinnes, and ſo defiled the land with the ſame ſinnes for the which the Canaanits were expelled, in the which gods true religion, holineſſe of life, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe ſhould haue raigned and flouriſhed.</p>
               <p>And this was the cauſe or matter of their inditement; in all which the Prophet aymeth at this, that he might bring the people to true repentance vpon ſome hope of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation; for whereas he ſaith that the Lord had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie with the people, hee doth herein include a ſecret admonition, that ſeeing the Lord was not only far mightier then they, but alſo had the law &amp; equitie on his ſide, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould labour after reconciliation, by turning vnto him by vnfayned repentance, for other meanes there was none to eſcape his juſt judgements. And this is indeed the maine end at which the Lord aymeth in all his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, namely that thoſe his people whom hee threatneth hearing of his judgements, might preuent and eſcape them by their repentance. For as a louing father when he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth his child, ſheweth that he hath no deſire to puniſh him, ſeeing by threatning hee giueth him warning to deſiſt from his faults, that ſo he may eſcape: ſo our gracious and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly father, threatneth his judgements in the miniſterie of the word, that heareing them wee may auoyd them, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking our ſinnes and humbling our ſelues before him, and this end of the Lords contending with his people is plainly <note place="margin">Eſay. 1. 18. Eze. 33. 10. 11. Ier. 18. 7. 8.</note> expreſſed. Eſay. 1. 18. Ezech. 33. 10. 11. Ier. 18. 7. 8.</p>
               <p>And ſo much concerning the cauſe why the Iſraelits are arraigned: Now wee are to ſpeake of the particular crimes <note place="margin">The ſinnes whereof the Iſraelits are accuſed and condemned.</note> whereof they are accuſed, conuicted and condemned; and theſe are of two ſorts: the firſt priuatiue or ſinnes of omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, verſe. 1. the ſecond poſitiue or ſinnes of commisſion. verſe. 2. The ſinnes of omisſion whereof they are accuſed,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:10737:195"/> either reſpect their neighbour or God himſelfe: thoſe that reſpect their neighbour are reduced to two heads. Firſt ſinnes of injuſtice vnder the word truth. Secondly, neglect of mercy. The ſinnes which reſpect God are all included vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one, namely that there was no knowledge of God in the land, and conſequently no religion, no faith, no obedience.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſinne whereof he accuſeth them is, that there <note place="margin">The firſt ſinne, that there was no truth in the land.</note> was no truth in the land: for the vnderſtanding whereof we are to know, that truth reſpecteth either the minde and hart, and then it is called ſimplicity or integritie, or elſe the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward carriage and behauiour, and that either in our words or ſpeaches, which properly is called veritie; or elſe in our workes and actions, which is called juſtice or vpright dealing.</p>
               <p>Whereas therefore he chargeth them that there was no truth in the land, the meaning is, that there was no ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie or integritie in their minds and harts, no verity in their ſpeaches, nor juſtice in their actions: and becauſe vertues and vices are contraries without meane, ſo that the denying of the one in a ſubiect capable of it, is the affirming of the other; therefore hereby hee implyeth when he ſaith there was no ſimplicitie in the land; that it was full of hipocriſie and diſsimulation; and when he affirmeth that there was no veritie, he implyeth that there was lying; and when he accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them to be without truth or juſtice in their actions, he intimateth alſo that they were full of all manner of fraud and deceit.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſinne whereof he accuſeth them is, that they <note place="margin">The ſecond ſinne, that they wanted mercy.</note> were without mercie; the word ſignifieth either benignitie or beneficence, and in the former ſignification it is referred to the minde and hart, and ſo is called mercy and compaſsion; and in the latter to the words and works, and then it is called beneficence, and comprehendeth in it all workes of charitie and chriſtianitie: as when in our words we are ready to help and benefit our brethren by exhortation, counſaile, conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, admonition and reprehenſion: and in our workes, by defending them with all our power, and relieuing them with
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:10737:195"/> our riches. Whereas therefore he chargeth them to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy, his meaning is that they were deſtitute of all theſe vertues, and neglected all theſe chriſtian duties; and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe he implyeth, that their minds were full of malice and cruelty, their words rotten and vnſauorie, their workes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with oppreſsion, violence and barbarous inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie.</p>
               <p>And theſe were the ſinnes which reſpected their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and the breach of the ſecond table: their ſinnes which immediately reſpected God are all comprehended in this, that there was no knowledge of God in the land: vnder <note place="margin">The third ſin, no knowledge of God.</note> which particular he compriſeth the neglect of all the duties injoyned in the firſt table, and of all religion &amp; piety; for as from the true ſauing knowledge of God, as from the root of all graces, there ſpringeth Faith, affiance, hope, loue, the feare of God, obedience, and all true worſhip of God: ſo contrariwiſe ignorance is the roote of all impietie, infidelity, diffidence, preſumption, deſpaire, hatred of God, contempt, diſobedience, ſuperſtition &amp; idolatrie. And therefore where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he chargeth them that they were without the knowledge of God, he neceſſarily implyeth that they were vtterly deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all grace, piety and all true religion, and guilty of the breach of all the commandements of the firſt table: for where the roote is dead there the braunches muſt needes periſh.</p>
               <p>Now theſe their ſinnes are aggrauated, in that hee ſaith, that there was no veritie, mercy, nor knowledge of God in the Land. Firſt, in that it was a Land which God in great mercy had beſtowed vpon them, to the end, that therin they ſhould worſhip and ſerue him; a land wherein he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and preſerued them; a land wherein he had plentifully afforded vnto them the meanes of attaining theſe graces of truth, mercy and knowledge: namely, his Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in that this impietie and neglect of Religion, did not onely lurke in ſome few corners, but ouerſpread the whole land: neyther were there onely ſome few men tainted
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:10737:196"/> with theſe vices and corruptions, but generally the whole body of the people. So that they did not onely hide theſe ſinnes as being aſhamed of them, but being come to bee as it were a common faſhion, they impudently profeſſed and defended them.</p>
               <p>And ſo much for the meaning of this firſt Verſe: the <note place="margin">That the Lord himſelfe will contend with thoſe who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie of his Prophets.</note> doctrines which are to be obſerued are theſe. Firſt, we here learne that if Gods Prophets haue long contended vvith a people in Gods cauſe, as his aduocates, and doe not preuaile with them, by cauſing them to humble themſelues before him by true repentance, then the Lord will take his cauſe into his owne hands, and ceaſing to contend with them any longer by his word and ſpirit, will proſecute his controuerſie with them by afflictions and puniſhments; and if hauing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſent his Ambaſſadours with reaſonable conditions of peace, men neglect them, and refuſe to hearken vnto their ambaſſage, then will this powerfull king march againſt them with an armie of his judgements, and neuer ceaſe encountring them with his plagues, till he hath eyther humbled or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed them. And this appeareth in this place, as alſo Gen. 6. 3. In the example of the Iewes, led captiue into Babilon, <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 3.</note> and afterwards deſtroyed by the Romaines. So that God firſt dealeth with men by his word; and then if this will not preuaile, by his chaſtiſements; and laſtly, if theſe will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them, by his deſtroying plagues and puniſhments. Would we therefore eſcape his corrections? then let vs ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer our ſelues to be reformed by his word: would we not be deſtroyed by his fearefull puniſhments? then let vs labour to profit by his gentle chaſtiſements.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof ſerueth for the comfort of Gods faithfull <note place="margin">A comfort for Gods mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note> Miniſters, when their perſons are diſgraced and contemned, and their Miniſterie neglected and dirided by wicked men; then they are to remember that they being the Lords aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates to pleade his cauſe againſt an impenitent people, are ſure to be ſtrongly backed by the Lords own power, wherby thoſe ſhall be brought vnder, who would not ſubmit them ſelues to be ruled by the ſcepter of the word.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:10737:196"/>
               <p> Secondly, it ſerueth for the terrour of all thoſe ſcoffers <note place="margin">A terror for contemners of Gods word.</note> and deſperate wicked men, who contemne and deride thoſe threatnings, which they heare denounced in the miniſterie of the word againſt them for their ſinnes: for let ſuch know, that if they will not be reclaimed from their wicked courſes, by the miniſtery of Gods Prophets, the Lord himſelfe will follow his owne cauſe, and ceaſing any longer to contend with them with his word and ſpirit, he will proſecute them by his judgements and puniſhments.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be obſerued, is Gods judiciall courſe <note place="margin">The juſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> of proceeding in the execution of his Iudgements: although being infinite in wiſedome, power, and juſtice, he might ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely inflict his puniſhments vpon ſinners, as ſoone as they haue offended, yet firſt (to approue the juſtnes of his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) hee doth in the Miniſtery of his word ſummon them before his ſeate of Iuſtice, arraigne and conuince them; that ſo they may be moued to ſue for a pardon, by turning vnto God by true repentance, &amp; hereby preuent deſerued puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. So he ſent <hi>Noah</hi> to the old world, before he brought the Deluge: <hi>Lot</hi> to Sodome, before he deſtroyed it with fire and brimſtone: <hi>Moyſes</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> before he drowned him in the red ſea: The Prophets to the Iewes and Iſraelites, before he brought them into Captiuitie: and our Sauiour Chriſt and his Diſciples, before their vtter deſtruction and deſolation. All which as it ſerueth to commend Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull juſtice; ſo alſo to condemne the hardnes of mens harts, and to leaue them without excuſe, who will not after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold warnings turne from their ſinnes, by vnfained repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that ſo they might eſcape theſe fearefull puniſhments.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas hee calleth this ſummons to Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">That the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the word is Gods owne voyce.</note> the word of the Lord, which notwithſtanding was pronounced not by the Lord immediately, but by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: hence we learne that the voyce of Gods meſſengers in the Miniſtery of the word, is to be eſteemed as the voyce not of mortall men, but as the voyce of the euerliuing God, <note place="margin">Luke. 1. 70. Heb. 1. 1. 2 Pet. 1. 21.</note> ſpeaking by them. So it is ſaid, Heb. 1. 1. that <hi>in old time God ſpake by his Prophets.</hi> And our Sauiour Chriſt ſaith that they
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:10737:197"/> who heare his Diſciples and Miniſters, doe heare him; and they who contemne them, contemne him. Luke. 10. 16. And <note place="margin">Luk. 10. 16.</note> thus haue the faithfull alwayes eſteemed the Miniſterie of the word, euen as the voyce of God himſelfe. So the Church Eſay. 2. 3. <hi>Cornelius.</hi> Acts. 10. 33. The Theſſalonians. 1. Theſ. <note place="margin">Eſa. 2. 3. Acts. 10. 33. 1 Theſ. 2. 13.</note> 2. 13. And ſo are we alſo to eſteeme of it, if euer we meane to finde it to be the ſtrong power of God to ſaluation vnto vs. When therefore in the miniſtery of the word, we heare ſweet conſolations offred to all that mourne, we mourning are to be comforted hereby, euen as if the Lord himſelfe from heauen ſhould ſpeake comfortably vnto vs: when we heare Gods Iudgements denounced againſt all vnrepentant ſinners, we liuing in our impenitencie, ſhould no leſſe be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified hereby, then if the Lord euen with his owne thundring voyce ſhould proclaime them againſt vs, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, whereas he ſaith, that the Lord had a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie <note place="margin">Gods mercies no juſt cauſe of ſecuritie.</note> with the inhabitants of the Land, vpon which he had beſtowed ſo many benefits: hence we learne, that Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer mercyes, multiplyed vpon a people, ſhould be no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue to perſwade them ſecurely and preſumptuouſly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their ſinnes without repentance, as though they were exempted from Gods Iudgements: nay rather the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Gods goodneſſe ſhould work in them amendment; otherwiſe they are to aſſure themſelues that if they abuſe gods grace, vnto wantonnes, impenitency, and forgetfulnes of him, the Lord will more ſpeedely and fearefully puniſh them then any other. If the Lord haue giuen vs pleaſures, and we abuſe them, the greater ſhall be our torments. Apoc. 18. 7. If he <note place="margin">Apoc. 18. 7.</note> giue vs power and authoritie, and we thereby become more inſolent, proud and rebellious, our Iudgements ſhall be the more increaſed, <hi>for the mighty ſhall bee mightely tormented.</hi> Wiſd. 6. 7. If his Goſpell and true Religion, and we bring <note place="margin">Wiſd. 6. 7.</note> forth no fruits thereof, neyther liue according to our holy profeſsion, it will not delay but haſten our puniſhments. 1 Pet. 4. 17. Ier. 25. 29. <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4. 17. Iere. 25. 29.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And ſecondly whereas the Lord denounceth his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt the inhabitants of the land generally: here we
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:10737:197"/> learne that a generall defection, ſhall bee puniſhed with a general puniſhment: for it is not with God as with men, <hi>Vbi multitudo peccantium tollit poenae locum,</hi> with whom the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of offenders doth cauſe impunitie: but he inflicteth <note place="margin">God puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth nationall ſinnes with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> vpon nationall ſinnes, nationall puniſhments: for it as eaſie with him to puniſh a whole countrey as one priuate man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore let vs take heede, that we doe not follow a whole multitude vnto euill, nor ſuffer our ſelues to be caried away in the common ſtreame of ſinne, leaſt the Lord alſo ſweepe vs away in the vniuerſall deluge of his puniſhments.</p>
               <p>Fiftly we may here obſerue, what is the cauſe of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies <note place="margin">That ſinne is the matter of controuerſie betweene God and vs.</note> betweene the Lord and the inhabitants of any land; namely their ſinnes whereby his law is tranſgreſſed. If therefore we would not haue the Lord, to be our enimie and aduerſary, if wee would not haue him to ſummon and arraigne vs before his judgement ſeate, and being conuicted to condemne vs to puniſhment; let vs flye ſinne, or hauing ſinned let vs ſue for pardon and reconciliation, by turning vnto the Lord and bewayling our ſinnes by vnfayned repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. It is the wiſe mans counſaile, that <hi>we ſtriue not with a</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 6 10. Eccleſ. 8. 1.</note>

For if it bee a fearefull thing to fall into the hands of a mightie man, how terrible is it <hi>to fall into the hands of the euerliuing God?</hi> As the Apoſtle ſpeaketh Heb. 10. 31. <hi>If</hi>

               <p>And theſe are the doctrines to be obſerued out of the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The doctrinea </seg>
                  </label> arraignment of the children of Iſraell before Gods tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall; now let vs in the next place conſider what inſtructions
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:10737:198"/> may be gathered out of their particular inditement, and out of the ſpeciall crimes laide to their charge, which are either ſinnes of omiſsion in this verſe, or of commiſsion in the next. Where firſt we are to obſerue, that to neglect a duty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, <note place="margin">To neglect a dutie is as well a ſinne as to commit a vice forbidden.</note> is reputed in Gods ſight a grieuous ſinne, as well as to commit a vice forbidden; and that we make God our aduerſarie, when he findeth vs emptie of goodneſſe as well as when wee are repleniſhed with euill: that though wee neuer actually committed any ſin, yet if we haue omitted thoſe dueties which God requireth it will be ſufficient mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for our condemnation. <hi>Meroz</hi> was curſed, not for figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt gods people, but becauſe they did not aſsiſt them in the battaile againſt the mighty. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 5. 23. <hi>Diues</hi> was tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in hell not for taking away food from <hi>Lazarus,</hi> but becauſe ſeeing him in want he did not relieue him. Luk. 16. The vnprofitable ſeruant was caſt into vtter darkneſſe, not for miſpending Gods tallent, but becauſe he had not well vſed it to his maiſters aduantage. Mat. 25. 27. 30. The fooliſh <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 27. 33</note> Virgins were ſhut out of the marriage chamber, not becauſe their Lamps were full of falſe light, deceit, rapine and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, but becauſe they were emptye of the oyle of faith, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and a good conſcience. Mat. 25. 3. And the reprobate are condemned at the day of Iudgement, not for taking the meate from the hungrie, but for not feeding them; not for diſlodging the ſtranger, but for not entertaining him; not for ſtripping the clothed, but for not clothing the naked, not for hurting and iniuring the ſicke and priſoner, but for not viſiting and comforting them. Verſe 41. 42. &amp;c. The reaſon hereof is, becauſe we being the Lords ſeruants, it is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <note place="margin">Mat. 41. 42.</note> that we doe not ſerue Gods enimies, or that we ſpend our time in idleneſſe, and ſerue no body; but wee muſt doe faithfull ſeruice to him our Lord and Maiſter, for which end he hath created and redeemed vs, and ſpend our liues not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in abſtayning from euill, but alſo in doing of good. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer vertue and vice being extreames without meane, hereof it followeth that the abſence of the one, in a ſubject capable of it, argueth the preſence of the other: ſo that if we
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:10737:198"/> be deſtitute of vertue, we are repleniſhed with vice: If our houſes be cleane ſwept and empty of Gods graces, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come forthwith fit habitations for vncleane ſpirits: if we be <note place="margin">Mat. 12. 44.</note> not indued with knowledge, we are blinded with ignorance: if we be deſtitute of faith, we are full fraught with infidelitie: if we ceaſe to doe good, immediately we beginne to doe euill. And therefore our ſinnes of omiſsion, being alwayes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſinnes of commiſsion, are ſufficient matter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement, for our iuſt condemnation whenſoeuer the Lord ſhall ſummon vs to appeare before him.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is, that wee doe not with ſimple ideots <note place="margin">That we muſt not bleſſe our ſelues in our harmleſnes.</note> bleſſe our ſelues, becauſe we are harmeleſſe and doe no man wrong, and becauſe we abſtaine from ſuch groſſe impieties, as we ſee others commit; for the Lord requireth that we not onely refraine from euill, but alſo that we doe good: ſo that it is not ſufficient that we doe not ſcorne Gods worſhip, if we doe not alſo religiouſly ſerue him; nor to abſtaine from biaſpheming Gods name, if we doe not alſo glorifie it; nor to forbeare doing wrong to our neighbour, vnleſſe alſo wee be ready to performe the duties of juſtice, charitie and chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie towards them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, out of the order which the Prophet vſeth in <note place="margin">The duties of Iuſtice the true Touchſtone of the duties of Pietie.</note> reprehending the peoples ſinnes, vve may obſerue that hee firſt conuinceth them of their ſinnes againſt their neighbors, and then of their ſinnes commited againſt God: and this methode is vſuall in the Scriptures, which the holy Ghoſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth: firſt, that he may beate downe the pride and vaine boaſting of hypocrites, who are ready to brag of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, faith, loue of God, and other hidden graces, though they be deſtitute of the loue of their brethren, and barren of good workes. And therefore he bringeth ſuch as theſe, who make a golden ſhew of ſpirituall and inward graces, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of God, to the true touchſtone of outward obedience, and the externall works of charitie and mercy towards their brethren; to the end that if they will not abide this tryall, it may appeare, that though they make neuer ſo glittering a ſhew of ſpirituall and hidden graces yet they are nothing but
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:10737:199"/> droſſe and Copper guilt. And this is the Touchſtone which Chriſt giueth vs, to diſcerne a Hypocrite from a ſound pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, namely, by their fruits, Mat. 7. 16. <hi>By their fruites ye ſhall know them.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Iames.</hi> Chap. 2. 18. <hi>Shew me thy faith, by thy works.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> likewiſe. 1. Ioh. 4. 20. <hi>If any man ſay I loue God, and hate his brother, hee is a lyar, &amp;c.</hi> And Chap. 2. 4. <hi>He that ſaith I know him, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth not his commandements, is a lyar, and the truth is not in him.</hi> Verſe 9. So our Prophet knowing how ready the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites of his time, were to brag of their Religion towards God, doth conuince them of the want hereof, by laying open their injuries and cruelties towards their neighbours. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this is done for the behoofe and benefit of Gods children, who by reaſon of their naturall blindneſſe, and ſelfe loue, cannot eaſily ſpye out their ſecret and hidden corruptions, but contrariwiſe are ready to flatter themſelues, with an opinion of a great meaſure of their ſpirituall graces: theſe alſo are to examine themſelues by this touch-ſtone, for their loue of God is not much, if their loue of their neighbour be but a little: their faith is not ſtrong, if their obedience be but weake: their knowledge is not great, if their practiſe be but ſmall, and their Religion is rooteleſſe, if it bee but fruitleſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas he includeth the breach of the firſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, <note place="margin">The true know ledge of God the fountaine of all ſound Obedience.</note> and all manner of impietie againſt God, vnder this one particular, that there was no knowledge of God in the land: hence we gather, that as true knowledge of God, is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all true obedience: ſo contrariwiſe ignorance is the cauſe of all neglect of Religion, of all impietie and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And this may further appeare, both by reaſon, and <note place="margin">Ignorance the root of all ſin.</note> alſo by manifold examples. By reaſon, for they that know neyther God, nor his will, they are ignoraunt of that which pleaſeth him and diſpleaſeth him, and therefore though they had ſome good intention to ſerue God, yet they muſt needs diſpleaſe him, through ignorance and errour. Againe who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſinneth, he alſo erreth according to that. Prou. 14. 22. <note place="margin">Prou. 14. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Doe they not erre that imagine euill?</hi> and thoſe that erre doe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:10737:199"/> erre eyther through ignorance or wilfull maliciouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for this cauſe ſinners are called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, ſuch as are ignorant, and through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance are deceiued. And ſinnes are called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, Ignorances. Heb. 5. 2. and 9. 7. <note place="margin">Heb 5. 2. &amp; 9. 7</note>
               </p>
               <p>So alſo this appeareth by examples. For this was the cauſe of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſsion; becauſe hee knew not Gods truth, both in his promiſes and threatnings. Gen. 3. Of the ſinne of <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> the Iſraelites; for the Lord himſelfe rendreth this reaſon, why his people <hi>erred, becauſe they had not knowne his wayes.</hi> Pſal. 95. 10. This made the Iewes <hi>to erre becauſe they knew not</hi>

                  <hi>the Scriptures.</hi> Mat. 22. 29. This cauſed them to <hi>crucifie the Lord of life.</hi> Act. 3. 17. And to become proud iuſticiaries, teſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Act. 3. 17.</note> in their owne righteouſneſſe, becauſe they knew not the righteouſneſſe of God. Rom. 10. 3. This was the cauſe of the <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 3.</note> Gentiles Idolatry. Gal. 4. 8. <hi>But when yee knew not God, yee</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>did ſeruice to them which by nature were not Gods.</hi> And of <hi>Pauls</hi> perſecuting Gods Saints. 1 Tim. 1. 13. <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And as this Ignorance is the cauſe of all vice and ſinne, <note place="margin">Ignorance tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations into ſinne.</note> ſo it maketh all our inclinations which are good and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, being guided with the light of knowledge, to degenerate and become euill: for example, Religion joyned with igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance bringeth forth Idolatry: deuotion joyned with Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, begetteth ſuperſtition: hope blinded with Ignorance, becommeth preſumption: and feare hereby is turned into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we here obſerue, that as ignorance is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <note place="margin">Ignorance the cauſe of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> of all ſinne, ſo alſo it is the cauſe of all puniſhment, for vvhen a land is deſtitute of the knowledge of God, then doth the Lord proclaime, that he hath a controuerſie with that people, and that he will after a reall manner plead againſt them, till he hath deſtroyed them with his Iudgements. And indeed many are the euils which in the Scriptures are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt men for this ſinne of Ignorance: as for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Lord threatneth that he will laugh at their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, &amp; ſtop his cares at their prayers, who hate knowledge.

               <p>The vſe of this doctrine ſerueth firſt, to refute the practiſe of the Papiſts, who vſe all meanes to extinguiſh the light of <note place="margin">Popiſh patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ignor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance reproued.</note> knowledge, and to bring into thoſe lands wherein they haue any authoritie, more then Aegyptian darkneſſe, and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ignorance. To which purpoſe they take away the preaching of the Goſpell, the onely ordinarie meanes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting faith, yea they cannot indure that the people ſhould injoy the ſun-ſhine of the ſcriptures, but interpoſe betweene it and their vnderſtanding, the dark cloude of an vnknowne tongue; they cannot abide that they ſhould behould this ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Pearle, &amp; moſt precious diamond, which would ſend forth his bright rayes in the darkeſt night of ignorance, but keepe it cloſe hidden and faſt locked from them, vnder the locke of an vnknowne language, perſwading the people that they may bee moſt deuout, vvhen they are moſt ignorant, and that being deſtitute of any true faith of their owne, they are notwithſtanding in good caſe if they haue onely an implicite faith, vvhereby they beleeue as the Church belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, though they know not what. But let all ſuch know who haue wilfully ſuffered themſelues to bee hudwinckt vvith
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:10737:200"/> this thick vaile of ignorance, that theſe Romiſh ſhauelings, doe notably abuſe the people to their perdition, ſeeing they take away knowledge, the root and foundation of all grace, vertue and obedience, and bring in ignorance the fountaine of all errour, ſinne and wickedneſſe; and conſequently make whole nations &amp; countries lyable to Gods judgements, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the knowledge of God and his true religion, is baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſerueth for the reproofe, of thoſe ignorant <note place="margin">Ignorant ideots reproued.</note> ideots, and ſecure worldlings, who content themſelues to liue ſtill in ignorance, being vtterly deſtitute of the knowledge of God and of his religion, and imagine that they are religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inough, if they haue a good meaning, and that they are exempted from gods judgements, and highly in his fauour, if they bee of a ciuill conuerſation and honeſt behauiour; though in the mean-time they remaine wilfully blind, ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their eyes againſt the light, and contemning or at leaſt careleſly neglecting all meanes of knowledge. But let ſuch know that being deſtitute of knowledge, they are alſo deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all ſauing grace, and that liuing in ignorance, they liue alſo in their ſinnes; and conſequently haue God their aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie, vvho will contend vvith them, and vnleſſe they repent adjudge them to deſerued puniſhments.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, this ſerueth to ſtop the mouthes of thoſe, eyther <note place="margin">Slaunderers of the Goſpell refuted.</note> fooliſh, or malicious ſlaunderers; vvho accuſe the preaching of the Goſpell, as the cauſe, which hath impayred the ſtate of the land, both by making it more to abound with ſinne, &amp; alſo more liable to Gods judgements.

Neuer ſuch want and ſcarcitie, plague and ſickneſſe, and all ſorts of miſeries. But let ſuch know that not the preaching of the goſpell, is the cauſe of all this, but the neglect and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Goſpell preached; and becauſe vvhileſt the light of Gods word ſhineth, yet men loue darkneſſe more then light, and therefore are iuſtly giuen ouer of God to a
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:10737:201"/> reprobate ſence. It is not our too much knowledge, which is the cauſe of our ſinnes and puniſhments, but our great igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, notwithſtanding the Lord hath a long time graunted plentifull meanes of knowledge: and as well may we ſay, that the light of the Sunne cauſeth men to ſtumble, and goe out of the way: that the faithfull ſurgeon and good ſalue doe make the ſore: that the Iudge maketh the theefe: or that the Law doth make tranſgreſſours: as that the word of God, or the knowledge thereof, ſhould be the cauſe, eyther of our ſinnes, or of our puniſhments.</p>
               <p>And ſo much for the doctrines which are to be obſerued <note place="margin">Application.</note> out of this firſt verſe. Now in the laſt place, let vs apply that which hath been ſaid, to our owne times, for our owne vſe &amp; benefit. And to this purpoſe let vs examine, what ſimilitude there is betweene the land of Iſraell, as it was in the time of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> and our owne Country in theſe dayes; and whether we are not guilty of the ſame ſins, whereof they are here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted: to the end that if we proue cleare and innocent, we may haue the comfort hereof in our owne conſciences; or if vve be found alike faulty, that wee may humble our ſelues by vnfained repentance. Otherwiſe let vs aſſure our ſelues, that if there be between vs ſimilitude of manners, there ſhall alſo be ſimilitude of puniſhment, if we be guilty of the ſame ſins, the Lord will take the ſame courſe with vs; that is, he will ſummon and arraigne vs before his Iudgement ſeate, where being conuicted, vve ſhall be condemned to ſuffer the like, or greater puniſhments.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſinne whereof he accuſeth them is, that there <note place="margin">Truth greatly faileth amongſt men.</note> was no truth in the land: in which reſpect, if vvee examine the ſtate of men in theſe dayes, wee ſhall finde that there is but too great ſimilitude betweene vs and them For may we not in our times, and in our land, take vp the complaint of the Prophet, that <hi>there is no truth?</hi> may we not juſtly ſay of theſe times, as the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> of his, namely, that <hi>truth is fallen in the ſtreete, and that it ſo faileth, that he who refraineth from euill maketh himſelfe a pray?</hi> Eſa. 59. 14. 15. For that we <note place="margin">Eſay. 59. 14. 15</note> may come to particulars: where are thoſe ſimple hearted

                  <hi>Nathaniels,</hi> in whom ther is no guile? how ſmal is the number <note place="margin">Simplicitie of heart eſteemed folly. Pſal. 15. 2.</note> of thoſe faithfull men, who ſpeake the truth from their harts? where almoſt ſhall a man finde, that integritie, ſimplicitie, and vprightneſſe of heart, which is in ſo many places of the Scriptures commended vnto vs, both by precept and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample? Nay, rather is not this ſimplicitie ſo much hated, that euen the name it ſelfe is had in reproch? for a ſimple man and a foole are commonly vſed in the ſame ſignification: and contrariwſe he is reputed moſt wiſe, who is moſt deceitfull, double hearted, and voide of truth. Is not euery where the ſerpentine ſubtilty in great requeſt, &amp; in the meane while the ſimplicitie of the Doue, not onely contemned, but alſo deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as if it were ſottiſh folly? is it not a chiefe point of pollicy in our dayes to pretend one thing, and intend another? to diſſemble hatred with lying lips, and Iudas-like to betray vnder coulour of kiſsing and imbracing? by all which it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeareth, that there is no truth, that is, no ſimplicitie nor ſinceritie in the hearts of men.</p>
               <p>But as truth is baniſhed from the hart and reines, ſo alſo <note place="margin">Truth of ſpeech much decayed.</note> from the tongue and ſpeach; for as men are double hearted, ſo alſo they are double tongued; and well may wee in our times complaine with <hi>Dauid.</hi> Pſal. 12. 1. 2. <hi>The faithfull are</hi>

Haue they committed any fault? preſently truth is ſould, to buy a couer of a falſe excuſe, wherewith they may hide it from thoſe, whom they are more loath to diſpleaſe then God himſelfe. Doe they hunt after the fauour of great parſonages? then truth muſt needes be ſould through baſe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:10737:202"/> flattery to purchaſe it. Would they ſpightfully reuenge them ſelues vpon their neighbour, and yet he ſhall neuer know who hurt him? they part with truth through backbiting and ſlandering, for which if at any time they are called in queſtion, they make vntruth their beſt ſalue to cure that wound which they haue made with their lying tongues. In a word the leaſt cauſe is thought ſufficient, to make men part with truth through falſe ſpeaking, and though it ought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Laſtly, as there is no place left for truth in mens hearts <note place="margin">No truth to be found in mens actions.</note> and tongues, ſo neither can it eaſily bee found in their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and behauiour, for as this age is double hearted and double tongued, ſo alſo it is full of double dealing; and as the Prophet ſpeaketh, <hi>Iuſtice ſtandeth a farre off.</hi> Eſay. 59. 14. For in this faithleſſe age, there is no reſpect of keeping pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <note place="margin">Eſay. 59. 14.</note> though it hath beene backed with many proteſtations, when as it may bee broken with ſome ſmall aduantage; neither is there any cable ſo ſtrong which can bind men to obſerue couenants concluded, when their fidelitie is attended with the leaſt loſſe or inconuenience. In ancient times when men eſteemed their credit more then wealth, their word was ſufficient in any contract; but when truth beganne to faile the law prouided for better ſecuritie, that couenants ſhould bee expreſſed and recorded in writing, and iniuſtice yet preuailing, ſeales vnto theſe writings were annexed: But in this truthles age all this is little worth vnleſſe men be bound in a double forfeyture of wealth, from forfeyting of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and credit, yea ſo boundleſſe is mens falſhood in theſe times, that bonds are not ſufficient to bind men to iuſt and honeſt dealing, vnleſſe they be alſo chained in ſtatutes and recogniſances.</p>
               <p>The like want of truth may be obſerued in all ſtates, and in all dealings betweene man and man, wherein truth is not <note place="margin">Want of truth obſerued amongſt all ſorts of men.</note> bought as being precious, according to the wiſemans coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayle, but ſould at vile priſes: It is ſould by ſtates men for treacherous pollicies; of Magiſtrates for rewards, friendſhip,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:10737:202"/> or reſpect of perſons; of Lawyers, for fees; it is commonly ſould of ſhop-keepers, that by the ſale of truth, they may make their wares more ſaleable; of Artificers, who ſupply all defects, eyther of their labour or bad ſtuffe, by vntruth and falſhood. And as this is the ſtate of Court and Citie, ſo alſo of the Country, where a man ſhall finde that the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſt haue wit enough to betray the truth; and the poorer that the people bee, the more ready are they to ſell truth at the baſeſt rate. And I would to God, this want of truth, were wanting in the Chruch, and that in the baniſhment of truth out of the common wealth, yet the Church might be a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary and place of refuge, where it might retire it ſelfe, and beſafe guarded from violence; but alas in theſe dayes, it is farre otherwiſe, for many in ſtead of Gods truth, preach their owne fantaſies &amp; froathy conceits of wit, raking in the pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of Popiſts poſtils, that they may ſtuffe their Sermons with ſuch dotages of wit, as better beſeeme the Stage then the Pulpit: leauing in the meane time the pure fountaine of Gods word, as though theſe waters of life were not worth the drawing, and loathing to bring any ſound expoſition of their Text, becauſe they imagine ſuch vulgar ſimplicitie to be a great diſparagement to the acutenes of their wit, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they chooſe rather to wreſt and wring the ſcriptures vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch ſenſes, as ſhall ſerue to be fit foundations, whereupon they may ground their idle quirkes, and wittie fooleries, then to deliuer any ſound interpretation, whereout they may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any wholeſome doctrine, and profitable inſtructions: vvherin they vtterly forget the preſence in vvhich they ſtand, the end wherfore they are ſent, the maieſtie and authority of the ambaſſage, and the grauitie required in ſuch ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours; and plainely ſhew, that they ayme not at the ſauing of ſoules, or the building of men vp in Chriſt, but that they gape after the wind of vulgar prayſe; that they enuy poets their fantaſticall wits, and therefore contend with them for the Lawrell, vvho ſhall moſt abound in giddy conceits; that they labour to rob Players of their popular applauſe, and to get to themſelues their thronged audience, when as their hearers
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:10737:203"/> may receiue as much delight, and as plentifully furniſh their treaſurie of wit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by comming to their exerciſes, as by frequenting the theaters. Others there are who with Ahabs Prophets betray the truth through baſe flatterie; diſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the truth becauſe it procureth hatred, and teach lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thinke this the beſt ladder whereby they may climbe vnto preferment: and ſuch are thoſe who preach proſp eritie, where the Lord threatneth ruine; who proclaime peace where the Lord denounceth warre; who ſo they pleaſe, care not how little they profit; who ſow the pillowes of gods mercies and put them vnder the elbowes of obſtinate and impenitent ſinners, that ſo they may with more ſecuritie, and leſſe checke of conſcience, continue in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee how much truth faileth in our dayes, both in the Church and common wealth; which may bee <note place="margin">Benignitie and mercy barniſhed</note> vnto vs a juſt cauſe of feare, that the Lord hath a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie with the inhabitants of this land: the like alſo may be ſaid of mercy, whether we vnderſtand therby, benignity and compasſion, or beneficence, conſiſting in the actions of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and chriſtianitie. In reſpect of the firſt, wee may vvell acknowledge, that this is the iron age of the world, wherein the moſt part of men are cruell, hard harted deſtitute of all pittie and compasſion, and quite ſenſeleſſe in the feeling of their neighbours miſeries, for who almoſt is touched with ſuch a fellow-feeling of other mens calamities, as beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth thoſe who profeſſe themſelues members of the ſame bodie? who is ready to mourne with thoſe that mourne, or to bee a co-partner in another mans griefe, if hee bee not alſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker in his miſerie? who being well clothed feeleth colde, when hee ſeeth anothers nakedneſſe? who abounding in wealth, compasſionateth anothers want? who injoying liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, is touched with the ſenſe of that wretchedneſſe which others feele that are impriſoned? who liuing in health, gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth at anothers ſickneſſe, or who liuing in ſecuritie, is touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with feare when hee ſeeth his neighbours daungers? and yet we boaſt our ſelues to bee members of Chriſt Ieſus, and

               <p>The like want alſo we haue of Chriſtian beneficence, <note place="margin">The great want of Chriſtian beneficence.</note> and of the works of mercy: for the coldneſſe of Charitie in the hart doth cauſe it alſo to freeſe in the tongue &amp; hand, for who almoſt in our time, is ready to inſtruct the ignorant, to exhort the ſluggiſh, to admoniſh thoſe who fall through weakneſſe, to reprehend thoſe who ſin through negligence or obſtinacy, to counſaile the ſimple or to comfort the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed?

               <p>Fourthly, in that the Lord hauing giuen vnto vs, ſingular meanes, of attaining vnto theſe rich ornamentes of the ſoule, namely his word printed, read, and preached amongſt vs, and the vſe of his Sacraments, yet we haue made no fruitfull vſe of them, but ſtill remaine in our ſpirituall nakedneſſe.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, in that theſe are not the ſinnes of ſome few per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but generally of the inhabitants of the land, which doe not hide themſelues in ſome ſecret corners, but walke bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the open ſtreetes, being priuiledged from both ſhame and puniſhment, in reſpect of the multitude of offenders.</p>
               <p>Seeing therefore we are guilty of the Iſraelits ſinnes, yea and haue aggrauated them by many circumſtances, what can we ſay for our ſelues why we ſhould not bee ſubject to their
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:10737:205"/> puniſhments? Seing there is no truth, nor mercie, nor know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God in the land, what can wee expect but that the Lord will contend with vs, and that not in verball contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies by the mouth of his miniſters, for though wee haue often heard them yet wee haue little regarded them, but haue contemned their perſons and diſpiſed their threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; neyther can we hope that he will any longer vſe his his fatherly corrections and gentle chaſticements, for theſe hee hath often vſed in vaine, as for example he hath diuers times ſummoned vs by famine, ſickneſſe, plague and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, daunger of enimies, yea and of late laid the head of our whole ſtate, as it were vpon the block, and lifted vp <note place="margin">The gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der treaſon.</note> the fearefull axe of his feirce iudgement, being ready to giue the mortall ſtroke; and yet are we hereby nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed from our ſins, nothing moued to the performance of any holy duties. And therefore ſeeing neyther words nor chaſticements are auaileable for our amendment, and ſeeing after that the Lord hath repriued vs as it were from the blocke yet we remaine vnreformed; what can wee further expect but that he ſhould in his feirce wrath ſweep vs away, in an vniuerſall deluge of his judgements, vnles we ſeeke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, and appeaſe gods anger, by ſpeedy humiliation, and vnfayned repentance.</p>

               <p>The ſinnes whereof they are here conuicted and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:10737:206"/> condemned, eyther immediately reſpect God and the breach of the firſt table, or their neighbour, and the breach of the ſecond Table: both which are firſt propounded, and then intended and aggrauated.</p>
               <p>The ſinnes which reſpect God and the breach of the firſt Table, are all compriſed vnder this one particular of ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: the word here vſed may eyther ſignifie ſwearing or curſing, and ſo is diuerſly tranſlated by diuers: but ſeeing it was the purpoſe of the Lord in this place to ſet downe a briefe Epitome of the peoples ſinnes, I ſee no reaſon why in our expoſition, we may not comprehend them both.</p>
               <p>Yea, but this people tranſgreſſed the firſt table in many other reſpects, as namely, by their groſe Idolatry, falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, contempt of Gods word, and profanation of his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, why then doth he onely here accuſe them of this ſin of ſwearing? I anſwere: hee doth vnder this one particular comprehend all the reſt, eyther becauſe this ſinne moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly raigned amongſt them, or els becauſe this prophane and falſe ſwearing is vſually accompanied with all impietie, for he that maketh no conſcience of vaine, vſuall and falſe ſwearing, maketh conſcience of no impietie.</p>
               <p>But let vs conſider what kinde of ſwearing is here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, neither muſt we vnderſtand this of all manner and kindes of ſwearing, ſeeing a lawfull Oath is in Gods word commaunded, as a notable part of his worſhip and ſeruice. So Deut. 6. 13. <hi>Thou ſhalt feare the Lord thy God, and ſerue</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 6. 13. and 10. 20.</note>

               </p>
               <p>But here onely vnlawfull ſwearing is condemned, which ſinne is diuerſly committed: as firſt in regard of the object, <note place="margin">Eſay. 65. 16.</note> when men ſweare by any thing beſides the Lord alone. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in reſpect of the manner, when as they doe not ſweare in truth, juſtice and judgement. Thirdly, in reſpect <note place="margin">Ier. 4. 2.</note> of the end, when as in their oathes, they do not chiefly ayme at Gods glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or their owne or their neighbors good: which ſinne they commit who ſweare raſhly, ordinarily, and in their
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:10737:206"/> rage and fury. But of this argument I purpoſe to ſpeake more largely elſe where, &amp; therefore I will here paſſe it ouer.</p>
               <p>The other ſinne ſignified by this word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is curſing and direfull imprecations, which is vſed againſt our ſelues, <note place="margin">Of Curſing.</note> or againſt our neighbours: againſt our ſelues, when as raſhly, vainely, and vnneceſſarily we inuocate Gods feareful Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt our ſtate, perſon, body or ſoule, for the need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe confirmation of ſome truth, eyther in our aſſeuerations or promiſes, or for the binding of our ſelues to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ſome vnprofitable or euil action.

The which is an horrible abuſe of Gods name, power and juſtice, when as we goe about to make him our inſtrument of vnjuſt reuenge, and the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner of our malicious and wicked outrages: and likewiſe a haynous ſinne againſt our neighbours, when as our malice exceeding our power, vve wiſh vnto them thoſe euils which we are not able to inflict. And this our Sauiour condemneth, though it be vſed againſt thoſe vvho curſe and perſecute vs. Math. 5. 44. So Rom. 12. 14. <note place="margin">Mat. 5. 44.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond ſinne, of which the people of Iſraell are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 14.</note> and conuicted, is <hi>Lying:</hi> for the better vnderſtanding <note place="margin">Of Lying.</note> whereof, that knowing it we may auoyde it, vve will conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the nature and kindes thereof.</p>
               <p>A Lye is, <hi>when by any meanes a man vttereth an vntruth, or the truth vntruely, and with a purpoſe to deceiue.</hi> So that <note place="margin">What a Lye is.</note> there are two ſorts of Lyes: the firſt, vvhen as a man ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not as the thing is: the ſecond, vvhen hee ſpeaketh the <note place="margin">2. Sorts of lies.</note> truth, but deceitfully, with a deſire to be otherwiſe vnderſtood then the truth is. The firſt which is a logicall or a reall Lye, is of two ſorts: firſt, when as a man ſpeaketh an vntruth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his minde and knowledge, and this is the chiefe kind of Lying, from whence in the Latine it hath his name: for <hi>mentiri, eſt contra mentemire.</hi> Secondly, when a man incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately and through errour vttereth an vntruth, thinking that hee ſpeaketh true, Which howſoeuer it bee a lie in the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:10737:207"/> generall ſignification, yet he that vttereth it cannot bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a lyar, becauſe howſoeuer his words agree not with the thing, yet they agree with his minde. Onely hee offendeth through inconſiderate raſhnes, in that hee affirmeth that as certaine truth, of which hee hath no certaine knowledge, and thereby giueth offence to thoſe that heare him, who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the vntruth but doe not know the minde of him that vttereth it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hee lyeth who ſpeaketh the truth with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to deceiue; not knowing that to bee true which hee auoucheth, or thinking it to be otherwiſe, or knowing it to <note place="margin">That he lyeth, who ſpeaketh the truth to deceiue.</note> bee truth deſireth to be vnderſtood otherwiſe then he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it: and this is as great a ſinne as a plaine lie; for as it is a leſſer fault in regard it hath more ſhew of truth, ſo it is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter becauſe it is ioyned with more deceipt. As therefore a man may pronounce an vntruth, and yet be no lyer ſo hee may be a lyar in vttering the truth, when as hee doth not ſpeake it with a ſimple heart.</p>
               <p>And theſe are the diuers kindes of lying, which are here condemned; the which howſoeuer they ſeeme ſmall ſinnes <note place="margin">That lying is a great ſinne in gods ſight.</note> in the ſight of men, as appeareth by their common practiſe, yet they are great in Gods ſight, and therefore carefully to be auoyded by all chriſtians: which that we may the rather doe, let theſe motiues perſwade vs.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe the Lord in the ſcriptures hath ſtraightly forbidden it, Leu. 19. 11. <hi>Ye ſhall not lye one to another</hi> Eph, <note place="margin">Leu. 19. 11.</note> 4. 25. <hi>Caſt of lying and ſpeake the truth euery man to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>for wee are members one of another.</hi> Col. 3. 9. <hi>Lye not one to another ſeeing ye haue put off the old man and his workes.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Col. 3. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe it is condemned as a greuous ſinne, namely as an abhomination to the Lord Pro 12. 22. as a ſin which God abhoreth Pro. 6. 17. As being the curſed off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring <note place="margin">Pro. 12. 22.</note> of that wicked father the diuell. Ioh. 8. 44. The which is to bee vnderſtood not onely of pernicious lyes, but alſo <note place="margin">Ioh. 8. 44.</note> merry lyes; for God condemneth it as a ſinne to make Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces merry with lyes. Hoſ. 7. 3. Yea of officious &amp; profitable lyes: For truth muſt not be ſould at any price; Pro. 23. 23. <note place="margin">Hoſ. 7. 3. Pro. 23. 23.</note>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:10737:207"/> And it is vnlawfull to lye for Gods cauſe. Iob. 13. 7. 9. and <note place="margin">Iob. 13. 7. 9.</note> therefore much leſſe for any worldly benefit.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as truth maketh vs to reſemble our heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <note place="margin">Lying maketh men reſemble the Diuell.</note> who is the authour and fountaine of truth; ſo Lying maketh men to reſemble the Diuell, who is the father of Lyes: and as truth is the badge or cogniſance of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in earth, and Heire of heauen; ſo Lying is a note and <note place="margin">Pſal. 15. 2.</note> token of one who is the ſonne of perdition: for Lyers haue their childes-part in the Lake which burneth with fire and <note place="margin">Apoc. 21. 8.</note> brimſtone.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, becauſe by Lying men looſe their credit, ſo as no man will beleeue them when they ſpeake the truth.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, becauſe it taketh away the true vſe of ſpeach, which <note place="margin">Lying ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throvveth the vſe of ſpeach.</note> is to expreſſe the meaning of the heart: and ouerturneth all humaine ſocietie, contracts, and commercements betweene man and man, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it maketh the Lord to proclaime, a controuerſie with vs, and to contend with vs by his heauie Iudgements, <hi>For a falſe witneſſe ſhall not be vnpuniſhed, and he that ſpeaketh Lyes ſhall not eſcape.</hi> Prou. 19. 5. <hi>But he ſhall periſh.</hi> Verſe. 9. <note place="margin">Prou. 19. 5. 9. Pſal. 5. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>And be deſtroyed.</hi> Pſal. 5. 6. As appeareth in the example of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira.</hi> Act. 5. And after this life he ſhall <note place="margin">Act. 5.</note> be <hi>ſhut out of Gods kingdome.</hi> Apoc. 22. 15. <hi>And be caſt into</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 22. 15. and 21. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>hell fire.</hi> Apoc. 21. 8.</p>
               <p>The third ſinne whereof they are conuicted and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <note place="margin">Of Killing.</note> is killing: whereby wee are not onely to vnderſtand the taking away of the life of man, which is murther in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree; but alſo all hurts, wrongs, and injuries offred againſt the perſon of their neighbour: for as in the former verſe, by the want of mercy was vnderſtood the want of loue, compaſsion, and all chriſtian beneficence; ſo by this ſinne of commiſsion oppoſed thereunto, we are to vnderſtand the contrary vices, cruelties, injuries and oppreſsion committed againſt the perſon and life of our brother. Againe it ſeemeth that it was the Prophets purpoſe in ſetting downe this ſhort Epitome of the peoples ſinnes, to bring them to an examati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of themſelues by the Law of God, that ſo the obſtinate
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:10737:208"/> might bee conuinced of their manifold tranſgreſsions; as though he ſhould ſay: if you, who vpon euery occaſion are ready to juſtifie your ſelues, would examine your hearts and conſciences, your liues and conuerſations according to Gods Law, you ſhould finde that you haue broken all and euery part therof: as namely, by ſwearing, lying, killing, ſtealing, &amp;c. Seeing then the Prophet in this place, hath relation vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Law of God violated by them, it followeth, that as theſe ſinnes are condemned in the Law, ſo alſo here. But in the Law is condemned not onely the capitall ſinne, which is ſpecified, but all other of the ſame kinde, with the meanes and occaſions thereof; and therefore whereas the Prophet doth accuſe them of Killing, hee doth vnder this one word include all other their ſinnes of this kinde and nature.</p>
               <p>As firſt, the killing and murther of the heart, to which is to be referred all vnjuſt anger, inueterate malice, repining enuie, purpoſe of taking priuate reuenge, diſdaine, rejoycing at other mens harmes, crueltie, diſcord and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the murther of the tongue, to which is referred, chiding, railing, curſing, ſcoffing, backbiting and ſlaundering.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the murther of the hands, vnder which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed all manner of violence againſt the perſon of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as quarrelling, fighting, wounding, and killing eyther of his body or ſoule.</p>
               <p>The fourth ſinne is Stealing, whereby (as in the former) <note place="margin">Of Stealing.</note> we are not onely to vnderſtand Theft in the groſeſt kind, as that open and violent Theft, which is called <hi>Rapina &amp; La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trocinium,</hi> Rapine and Robberie, or that ſecret and deceitfull Theft, which we call <hi>Furtum,</hi> that is, pilfering and ſtealing; but alſo all manner of vnlawfull meanes, whereby our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is defrauded and depriued of his goods, whether they be condemned by humaine Lawes, or allowed and tolle ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And this is a Tree which ſendeth forth many branches: <note place="margin">The diuers kindes of theft.</note> For eyther this theft is committed out of contract, or in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract: to the firſt we are to referre all violent and forcible courſes, taken for the ſpoyling our neighbour of his goods. As firſt oppreſsion, wherby thoſe who excel others in power <note place="margin">Oppreſſion.</note>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:10737:208"/> authoritie and riches, are ready to deuoure &amp; ſwallow vp the poore, to grinde their faces, feed vpon their ſweat, and euen drink their bloud; of ſuch we read. Eſay 3. 14. 15. Micah. 3. <note place="margin">Eſay. 3. 14. 15.</note> 2. 3. And in this reſpect thoſe oppreſſors are called roaring <note place="margin">Micah. 3. 2. 3.</note> Lyons, and deuouring Wolues. Zeph. 3. 3. And this oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <note place="margin">Zeph. 3. 3.</note> is committed eyther through meere violence, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out coulour of Law, which is the vſuall Theft of Tyrants, and cruell Land-lords: or elſe when ſome ſhew of Law is pretended; which is called extortion, and is the ſinne eyther of Magiſtrates, who make Lawes for the oppreſsion of the common wealth, who take bribes to betray the cauſe of the innocent, who preſſe the extreamitie of the Law, and ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtand vpon the outward letter, though in reſpect of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances it be without all equitie.</p>
               <p>Or elſe of officers, who inhaunce their fees, &amp; grate vpon the poore, delaying the diſpach of his buſineſſe, vnleſſe for expedition their dueties be doubled and trebled.</p>
               <p>Or elſe of Lawyers, who taking vpon them to bee the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons of poore mens cauſes, become latrones of their goods: robbing and ſpoyling whole common wealths vnder cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of righting the wronged, and maintaining equitie and Iuſtice.</p>
               <p>Or elſe of Miniſters, who fleece the ſheepe, eate the milk, and cloth themſelues with the wool, but doe not feede the flock; being eyther vtterly vnfurniſhed of ſufficient gifts, or being ſufficient, neglect their duety through idleneſſe or for ambition.</p>
               <p>Or elſe, this theft is committed by the people, who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſpirituall things from their Miniſters, will not commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate vnto them their carnall things, but by fraudulent or violent courſes with-hold from them that neceſſary and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient maintenance, which both by the lawes of God &amp; man is allotted and allowed vnto them. The which howſoeuer it is eſteemed a ſmall fault, or none at all, yet it is not onely theft, but Sacriledge in Gods ſight, as appeareth. Mal. 3. 8. <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond kinde of theft is cloaked and diſguiſed vnder the habite of lawfull contracts, vnto which we may referre
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:10737:209"/> all manner of deceipt and fraud vſed in buying and ſelling, vſurie ſelling time vnder ſhew of giuing credit and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>All which kindes of theft are grieuous ſinnes in Gods ſight, forbidden and condemned in gods Law, Exod. 20. 25. <note place="margin">Exod. 20. 25.</note> And puniſhed in this life with gods curſe.

               </p>
               <p>The laſt ſinne, whereof they are accuſed and conuicted, <note place="margin">Of whoredom and the diuerſe kinds of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe.</note> is whoring, by which wee are to vnderſtand all manner of vncleannes, eyther internall in the minde, or externall in the body: the internall are the vncleane luſts of the fleſh, which are eyther ſuddainely intertayned, condemned by Chriſt, Math. 5. 28. or nouriſhed and retained, which the Apoſtle, calleth burning. 1.

Whereby he implyeth, that the people were deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giuen ouer to work wickedneſſe, ſo as they would not be contained within any bounds, not reſtrained with any fence, namely the law of God, his feare, ſhame, nor puniſhment, but violently ruſhed through all theſe hedges, into the open paſtures, and broad wayes of all ſinne and wickedneſſe; yea, the more they were ſtopped in theſe ill courſes, the more their ſwelling luſts ouerflowed, ſpreading ouer the whole country, with an vniuerſall deluge of impietie and iniquitie.</p>
               <p>The ſecond adjunct, whereby their ſinnes are aggrauated, is expreſſed in theſe words: <hi>And bloud toucheth bloud.</hi> For the vnderſtanding whereof, wee are to know, that bloud in the Scriptures often ſignifieth grieuous ſinnes, together with the guilt and puniſhment, which doth accompany them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he that ſinneth, maketh himſelfe guilty of his bloud, which as a juſt puniſhment, hee deſerueth to ſhead in lue of his tranſgreſsion.

                  </label> the Iſraelits who were gods people, and profeſſed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, did not onely fall into theſe ſinnes, but were growne into a habite of committing them; hence wee learne what is the nature of ſinne; if wee yeeld neuer ſo little vnto it, it will gaine vpon vs; if wee entertaine it but once it will come againe without bidding, and if wee bid it wel-come the ſecond time, it will grow ſo ſtrong and impudent that it will not away but become a dayly gueſt, yea and it will not come alone, but bring with it his companions alſo. The beſt way therefore to bee ridde of it, is when it firſt offereth <note place="margin">That we muſt reiect the firſt motions of ſin</note> to enter to ſhut the dores of our harts againſt it, and to turne it backe with a frowning countenance; for if wee doe not giue it a repulſe, it will continually haunt vs, till at laſt with his pleaſing allurements it haue perſwaded vs, to keepe open houſe for the free entertainment of all ſinne and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe. But if wee haue already fallen into any ſinne, then our beſt courſe is quickly to expell it, and to take heed that it doe not take poſſeſsion of vs, and ſo pleading cuſtome grow to a habite and ſecond nature: For it is our mortall

It is the Ague of the ſoule, for the curing whereof, the beſt methode in ſpiritual Phyſicke, is to preuent it before it come, and to take away the cauſes thereof, or if through our ignorance and vnwarineſſe we are fallen into it: we are at the firſt to apply ſpeedy meanes for our recouerie, for if it once ſeaſe vpon vs wee ſhall not leaue ſinne till ſinne leaue vs.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof tendeth to meete with a deceiueble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit <note place="margin">A deceiueable conceit of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered and refuted.</note> of our corrupt nature, which being ſo terrified by gods Law, and fearefull judgements, that it cannot reſolue to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a conſtant courſe in ſin, will yet preſumptuouſly bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row leaue of God for once or twiſe, with a purpoſe then to giue it ouer.

And in the ſecond place let them know, that the more their dropſie ſoules, ſwelling with preſumption, drinke of theſe waters of iniquitie, the more they thirſt: the more they liſten to theſe Syrens, the more they are inueigled with them: &amp; if they are vnable to reſiſt the aſſaults of ſinne, when they are vnconquered, in their ful ſtrength, without maime or wound, and aſsiſted by Gods ſpirit, how much leſſe will they bee able to ſtand in the incounter, when they are once ſpoyled, weakned, maymed, vvounded, eſpecially Gods ſpirit, which by their preſumptuous ſinnes they haue grieued being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from them?</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be obſerued is, that he comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <note place="margin">All impietie compriſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vnlavvfull ſwearing.</note> all impietie and the whole breach of the firſt table, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this one ſin of vnlawfull ſwearing: and as in the former Verſe, he had compriſed all the ſinnes of omiſsion, vnder the want of knowledge as being the fountaine of all the reſt, and the internall root from which they ſpring; ſo here he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth all ſinnes of commiſsion vnder this one of abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Gods holy name, which is an external ſin of the tongue. Firſt, becauſe it is an vndoubted ſigne &amp; an inſeperable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of all manner of wickedneſſe; for hee that maketh no conſcience of blaſpeming Gods holy name, by eyther falſe, or vaine and idle oathes, he maketh conſcience of no ſinne, but would (if he might with as little diſgrace and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger doe it) commit all manner of impietie; hee that will not be reſtrained by Gods feare, loue, mercy, goodneſſe, and the manifold benefits which he hath receiued of him, from vaine ſwearing, whereby he receiueth no profit, but loſſe, euen the loſſe of Gods fauour, the aſſurance of ſaluation, of a good conſcience, and of reputation amongſt thoſe that feare God; nor any pleaſure, vnleſſe he take (like the Diuell himſelfe) a helliſh pleaſure in acting ſinne, and deſpiting God; nor hath thereby any credit, but rather is branded with the black marke of a prophane perſon; hee that will contemptuouſly trample vnder feete the precious body and bloud of Jeſus
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:10737:212"/> Chriſt, which he ſpared not to giue for our redemption, and ſo irreligiouſly ſcorne the greateſt benefit that euer the Lord beſtowed vpon vs, it is not to be doubted, but that this man what ſhew ſoeuer hee maketh, is a prophane perſon: who when hee is allured by the baites of the world, riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and pleaſures, will not ſtick to commit any manner of wickedneſſe, ſeeing he is ready to commit this horrible ſinne of blaſpheming gods name, being induced therunto without any reſpect of the leaſt good.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he implyeth vnder this one ſinne of ſwearing, all the ſinnes commited againſt the firſt table; becauſe all theſe ſinnes are linked together and ſo inſeperably ioyned one with the other, that whoſoeuer is held in bondage vnder one of them, he is ſubiect to the reſt; according to that, Iam. 2. 10. <hi>Whoſoeuer ſhall keepe the whole law, and yet faileth in</hi>

               <p>The vſe hereof is, that we make conſcience not onely of one, but of all Gods Commandements, and that we carefully auoyde, not onely this or that ſin as <hi>Herod</hi> did, but all kinds and degrees of ſin; eſpecially falſe or vaine ſwearing, for this alone includeth or neceſſarily inferreth all manner of impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and therefore let blaſphemous ſwearers make at ſome times what ſhew of religion they will, yet vve may ſafely and ſurely conclude with the Apoſtle as in the generall, ſo eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of this ſinne of blaſpheming Gods Name, that if <hi>any amongeſt you, ſeemeth Religious, and refraineth not his</hi>

The violence thereof if once it hath taken full poſſeſsion of vs is ſuch, that neither Gods loue, mercie and manifold benefits, nor yet his law, fearefull curſe, feirce wrath nor terrible judgements will reſtraine vs from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing head-long into it; yea rather ſinne will take occaſion by the commaundement to worke in vs all manner of concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſence; as appeareth, Rom. 7. 8. And ſuch is the contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous infection thereof, that it will not be contained in the <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 8.</note> perſons who are alreadie poyſoned there-with, (but like a riuer which hath ſwelled ouer his bankes) ouerfloweth a whole countrey. And as the canker, or gangreene, hauing taken one member of the bodie, if it be not preſently cured, or cut off doth corrupt the next, vntill it haue rotted the whole body: ſo if ſinne hauing tainted ſome few members of a body politicke, bee not by wholeſome lawes and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of juſtice killed and ſuppreſſed, it will like the gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greene ſpread ouer and corrupt the whole bodie of the common wealth.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is, Firſt that if ſinne haue made an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance <note place="margin">The vſes.</note> into vs, wee labour to caſt it out, before it haue taken full poſſeſsion, and that wee cruſh in peeces this Babiloniſh broode, before they grow too ſtrong for vs.</p>
               <p>Secondly it ſerueth for the confutation of the fooliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit <note place="margin">The follie of thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer repentance.</note> and practiſe of worldly men, who nouriſh their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and deferre their repentance from yeare to yeare, thinking that howſoeuer it is now ſome-what difficult to maiſter their ſinnes, yet hereafter they may do it at pleaſure: but let ſuch know, that the longer their ſinnes grow vpon them, the more hardly will they be ſubdued, &amp; if now they ſeeme too ſtrong for them, let them aſſure themſelues, that in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:10737:214"/> further proceſſe of time they will grow altogether vnreſiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; neyther will any fence reſtraine them from running and ruſhing into the pleaſant paſtures of ſinne and wickedneſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſeeing ſinne is of ſuch a contagious, ſpreading, and ouerflowing nature; this muſt make vs carefull to auoid the company of wicked men, leaſt vve be tainted with their corruptions; and if it haue like a generall Deluge ouerflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the whole country where vvee dwell, then as <hi>Noah</hi> was preſerued from drowning, by keeping himſelfe within the Arke, ſo if vvee would not bee drenched and drowned in this Sea of corruption, which ouer-ſpreadeth the whole earth, vvee muſt keepe our ſelues in the Arke of Gods Church, and frequent the company of Gods faithfull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for if we haunt the fellowſhip of the wicked, we ſhall be ſurely caryed away in the ſtreame both of their ſin and alſo of their puniſhments.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, more particularly it teacheth Magiſtrates and <note place="margin">Superiors muſt ſuppreſſe ſinne before it bee growne too ſtrong and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</note> Maiſters of Families, to ſuppreſſe ſinne in thoſe committed to their charge, before it be growne ouer ſtrong and violent, leaſt it make head againſt all lawes and good orders, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge freedome and impunitie, in reſpect of the multitude of thoſe that offend, and ſo grow to ſuch audacious impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that it dareth to vaunt it ſelfe againſt goodneſſe, and to diſdaine and ſcorne all vertue and godlineſſe. Let them ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and when they ſee an Iſmaelite ſcoffing at the children of promiſe, let them, if there be no other meanes to reforme him, caſt him out of the familie: If there be an <hi>Abimilech,</hi> let him bee ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or remoued, leaſt hee deſtroy the whole linage of the godly, and diſturbe the Church &amp; common wealth. Iudg. 9. <note place="margin">Iudg. 9.</note> If <hi>Eli</hi> know the wickedneſſe of <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas,</hi> and <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. &amp; 3.</note> will not correct them, it will bring the heauie Iudgements of God vpon the whole poſteritie: If <hi>Dauid</hi> cocker <hi>Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 Sam. 15. and 16.</note> and will not keepe him vnder, in the end he will conſpire againſt him, and draw the whole people into his rebellion. Let therefore all Magiſtrates and houſholders propound <hi>Dauids</hi> practiſe for their patterne. Pſal. 101. that is, let <note place="margin">Pſal. 101.</note>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:10737:214"/> them reſolue not onely to ſuppreſſe the vvicked in the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and common wealth, but let them doe it betimes, as hee proteſteth verſ. 8. leaſt as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh of the ſonnes of <hi>Zeruiah,</hi> they grow in the end too ſtrong for them.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing to bee obſerued is, that hee calleth their <note place="margin">Sinne bringeth vpon vs, the greateſt guilt &amp; puniſhment.</note> hainous ſinnes by the name of bloud; to note both vnto them and vs, that ſin maketh vs ſubiect to the greateſt guilt and puniſhment, euen to the ſhedding of bloud, yea, our dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt life bloud. So the Lord threatned our firſt parents. Gen. 2. 17. <hi>In the day that yee eate thereof, yee ſhall dye the death.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 17.</note> And Ezech. 18. he reckoneth vp diuers ſinnes, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <note place="margin">Exech. 18. 13.</note> that he who committeth any of them, <hi>ſhal dye the death, and that his bloud ſhall be vpon him.</hi> Verſe. 13. And this was ſignified by the ſacrifices of the Law, in which for the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of ſinne, was required the ſhedding of bloud: for the the Apoſtle ſaith, Heb. 9. 22. almoſt all things are by the <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 22.</note> law, purged with bloud, and without ſhedding of bloud there is no remiſsion. In the offring whereof the law prouided, that <note place="margin">Leu. 1. 4. and 3. 8.</note> the offender ſhould lay his hands vpon the head of the beaſt which vvas ſlaine, thereby teſtifying that by his ſinne, hee had juſtly deſerued that death which the poore beaſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Not that the bloud of Buls and Goates could take away the guilt and puniſhment of ſinne, but onely the precious bloud of Chriſt, which was therby ſignified and prefigured. Heb. 9. 12. <note place="margin">Heb. 9. 12.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The vſe of this ſerueth, firſt, to make vs moſt carefull in <note place="margin">That we muſt carefully auoid ſinne.</note> abſtayning from all manner of knowne ſinnes; ſeeing they make vs ſubject to the greateſt guilt and puniſhment, and bring our deareſt bloud vpon our owne heads. There is no malefactour ſo deſperate, that would commit a capitall crime if he were aſſured that he could not eſcape the hands of his juſt Iudge: but all our ſinnes are capitall, and deſerue death both of body and ſoule; neyther can wee flye the preſence of the juſt Iudge of heauen and earth, and therefore no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, riches nor preferments ſhould perſwade vs to commit ſinne, whereby vve make our ſelues liable to ſuch heauie pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:10737:215"/>
               <p> Secondly, if wee haue ſinned, this conſideration ſhould <note place="margin">If we haue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned we muſt carefully ſeeke reconciliation with God.</note> moue vs moſt earneſtly to labour that Gods wrath may be appeaſed, his juſtice ſatisfied, and that we may be freed from the heauie burthen of ſinne, which maketh vs ſubiect to death and condemnation. And conſidering that the guilt and puniſhment can not otherwiſe bee done away, but by bloud, euen by the precious bloud of Ieſus Chriſt, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone purgeth away all ſinne. 1 Iohn 1. 7. Therefore when <note place="margin">1 Iohn. 1. 7.</note> our conſciences are guilty of ſinne, let vs labour aboue all things in the world to apply vnto our ſelues the vertue of Chriſts bloud, death and merits, and hunger and thirſt after his righteouſneſſe, that thereby being juſtified, we may ſtand righteous in his ſight.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it ſerueth to confute the conceipt of the ſecure <note place="margin">Their conceipt confuted, who make light ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſinne.</note> men of the world, who make but a May-game of ſinne, and imagine that they can appeaſe Gods wrath for all their hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous wickedneſſe, by a broken ſigh, or by ſaying, Lord haue mercy vpon vs, for we are all ſinners; or by making ſome counterfaite ſhew of repentance in their ſickneſſe, or when they lye vpon their death beds: as alſo it refuteth the doctrine of the Papiſts, who ſo lightly eſteeme of ſinne, that they teach it may be done away, by auricular Confeſsion, Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, humaine Satisfactions, Pilgrimages, ſaying ouer of ſo many Pater-noſters, Aue-Maryes, and Creedes, by a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops bleſsing, and Popiſh Pardons: but vve are to know that howſoeuer they eſteeme of it, yet it is ſo odious in Gods ſight, that no ſatisfaction can be made for it, but by the alone ſufficient ſacrifice of Chriſts bloud, in which if we haue not part, our bloud will be vpon our owne heads, and the guilt and puniſhment of our ſinnes will euer remaine vpon vs.</p>
               <p>And ſo much for the doctrines and vſes which are to be <note place="margin">Application.</note> obſerued out of theſe words: Now in the next place we are to apply them to our owne times, and to examine whether we <note place="margin">That vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſwearing exceedingly aboundeth.</note> bee not guiltie of thoſe ſinnes of which the Iſraelites are her conuicted and condemned. The firſt ſinne is ſwearing, in which reſpect if we take a generall ſuruey of our ſtate, we ſhall finde that we may well take vp <hi>Ieremies</hi> complaint, that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:10737:215"/> becauſe of oathes this land mourneth. Ier. 23. 10. For the <note place="margin">Ier. 23. 10.</note> name of God was neuer ſo prophaned and blaſphemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people of Iſraell, as in this ſinfull nation, neither can wee finde that they euer ſo lightly, vainely, and impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly abuſed the dreadfull and glorious name of their <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houah,</hi> as it is abuſed amongſt vs: nay contrarywiſe we find that it was vſuall with them to rent their garments, when they hard Gods name blaſphemed, which if we ſhould do in our dayes, we ſhould neuer go in whole apparel, &amp; the whole wealth of the land were ſcarce ſufficient to furniſh the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with clothes: yea ſuch a ſuperſtitious reſpect they had of the name of God, that numbring by letters they durſt not vſe the letters <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> becauſe one of Gods names was thereby expreſſed, but in ſtead of them vſed <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> leſt the name of god ſhould be prophaned by common vſe; whereas amongſt vs the fearefull name of God is vſed, without all reſpect in jeſts and May-games, common ſwearing, and impious curſing. But the more full handling of this point I will reſerue for a larger diſcourſe of this argument.</p>
               <p>And ſo much concerning the ſinne of ſwearing; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinne, ſignified by the ſame word is curſing, and direfull <note place="margin">That wicked curſing is rife in theſe times.</note> imprecations. The which ſinne alſo, doth exceedingly raigne in this our land, and pulleth downe gods heauie judgements vpon vs: for are men ſporting themſelues in their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures &amp; recreations, if any thing croſſe them in their delights what Poxes, Plagues and miſcheifes, will their accurſed curſing mouthes thunder out? are they about their worldly affaires &amp; buſineſſe, if they doe not ſort according to their deſire what direful curſes wil they vtter? if they be by any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident incenſed with anger, they haue no readyer way to eaſe themſelues, then by belching out of their poyſonous ſtomacks, curſes and blaſphemies; neyther is there any thing priuiledged from this their impious furie: for not onely their enemies who haue injured or abuſed them, are thought fit ſubiects vpon whom they may lay their heauy curſes, but alſo their friends who are neere and deare vnto them, yea what ſoeuer commeth next to hand; ſometimes they thus reward
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:10737:216"/> their poore ſeruants for their painefull ſeruice; ſometimes their ſeelie cattell are thus requited, for all the vſe and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which they haue by them; yea ſometimes the children of their owne bowels haue theſe helliſh bleſsings beſtowed vpon them, and that vpon ſmall and trifling occaſions; nay ſuch is their ſenſleſneſſe in this ſinne that they are ready to curſe the ſenſteſſe creatures, and that oftentimes when there is no fault in them, which are onely their bare inſtruments, but in themſelues who for want of heede, wit, or prouidence, could vſe them no better: but let ſuch curſers know, that the <note place="margin">The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> curſes which they haue ſtill in their mouthes, ſhall fall vpon their owne heads; and that they are but like ſtones or balls caſt againſt a hard wall, which hurt it not but rebound vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the throwers. Let them remember the ſaying of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt. Pſal. 109. 17. <hi>As hee loued curſing, ſo ſhall it come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 109. 17. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>him, and as hee loued not bleſſing ſo ſhall it bee farre from him.</hi> 18. <hi>As hee clothed himſelfe with curſing like a rayment, ſo ſhall it come into his bowels like water, and like oyle into his bones.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And well were it, if hee that curſeth did beare the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his owne ſinne himſelfe alone; but it is otherwiſe: <note place="margin">Curſing mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth liable to Gods iudgements.</note> for where curſing aboundeth, it cauſeth the Lord to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime a controuerſie with the whole land, and to inflict vpon it his heauie judgements. The which as it ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly reſtraine men from this horrible ſinne, becauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they make not onely themſelues, but alſo their deare country liable to grieuous puniſhments; ſo alſo it ſhould moue Chriſtian magiſtrates to bee carefull in the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of this vice, ſeeing where it aboundeth, there the whole country lyeth open to Gods fearefull plagues.</p>
               <p>The third ſinne whereof the Iſraelits are accuſed, is Lying, in which reſpect if we take a view of our land, wee <note place="margin">That the ſinne of lying is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in theſe times.</note> ſhall finde that neither they, nor the Cretians themſelues exceeded our people in this vice. For looke amongſt all ſorts and conditions of men, and it will plainely appeare, that al ſorts of lyes abound: vaine lyes, which haue no other end but to keepe their tongues in vre: merry lyes, for to
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:10737:216"/> that paſſe are men come, that they will lie for recreation, &amp; ſport themſelues in their wickednes: officious lyes for gaine and aduantage, though it be joyned with the loſſe of their ſoules: yea, and pernitious lyes, tending to the hurt, reproach and ſlaunder of their neighbours. If we take a view of ſtate pollicie, vvee ſhall finde that their <hi>mixta prudentia,</hi> which is ſo much admired and highly eſteemed, is nothing elſe but a mixture of worldly wiſedome with aduantageable lying and deepe diſsimulation. Looke amongſt our Lawyers, who take vpon them to maintaine truth and juſtice: and you ſhall ſee a common practiſe of lying in their falſe pleas and allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, joyned with an impudent facing out, and diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing of Truth, tending to the ouerthrow of juſtice, inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and the aduancement of wrong and oppreſsion: the which ſinne is more daungerous to the ſtate, becauſe theſe ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars are licenſed and countenanced in their ſinne, and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſay what they will or can for their Clyent, though it be neuer ſo falſe, without check or controulement. Examine the ſtate of the Citie, and you ſhall finde, that among buyers and ſellers there is ſcarce any bargaine made without the help of many Lyes; the which they finde ſo beneficiall for the increaſe of their wealth, that they would not ſell their gaines which they get by Lying, for that which they get by their honeſt labours: yea, ſo highly is this ſin in fauour with them, that they reade a Lecture of lying to their ſeruants, which who ſo beſt learneth, he is eſteemed the fineſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and fitteſt to be imployed in his maiſters moſt waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty buſineſſes. On the contrary ſide, he that is not expert in this Lying skill, eyther being naturally inclyned to honeſt dealing, or elſe becauſe he maketh conſcience of his wayes, ſuch an one though neuer ſo faithfull and painfull in his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, is in no fauour with his maiſter, but eſteemed a heauy headed and dull witted fellow, altogether vnfit for any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. Yea ſo little account or conſcience is made of this ſinne, that vpon euery tryfling occaſion it is thought fit to be vſed: for let a mangoe to another but to ſpeake with him, at his houſe, and he ſhall find all ſeruants generally inſtructed
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:10737:217"/> to returne a Lye, that they know not whether their maiſter be within, but they will goe ſee; and if the maiſter liketh not the party or his buſineſſe, then at the returne of the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Lye is doubled. Doe theſe men thinke we beleeue the Scriptures, that a Lye is abhominable in Gods ſight, that <note place="margin">Prou. 12. 22. and 6. 17. Apoc. 22. 15. and 21. 8.</note> he abhorreth it, that the Lyar ſhall be excluded out of Gods kingdome, and caſt into the Lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone? without doubt eyther they are ſo invred to Lying, that they meaſuring God by themſelues, doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue his truth, or elſe they neuer meditate or thinke vpon it; for there is none ſo gameſome that would leape into hell fire for ſport; there is none ſo couetous that would wittingly and willingly ſell his ſoule for euery ſmall trifle, which is of more value then the whole world; there is ſcarce any ſo giuen ouer to deſperate wickedneſſe, that would haue his ſeruant by a Lye to hazard his ſaluation, which daunger might bee preuented by vndergoing little or no inconuenience.</p>
               <p>The fourth ſinne laid to the Iſraelites charge is Killing; <note place="margin">That the land is defiled with blood.</note> the which we muſt needs acknowledge doth exceedingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in this land, in all the kinds &amp; degrees thereof: for firſt, if we examine our ſtate concerning murther in the higheſt nature, we muſt needes acknowledge that our country is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly defiled with bloud: for how many outragious and more then barbarous Murthers haue beene committed in euery corner of this Land, within the compaſſe of a few yeares? how many openly haue beene ſlaughtered by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate Ruffians in frayes and quarrels? how many murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Theeues and Robbers? how many traiterouſly poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, and priuily made away by treacherous enimies? the which bloudy ſinnes being committed by ſome priuate men, would not lye ſo heauy vpon the whole ſtate if they had ben ſeuerely puniſhed by the Magiſtrates, and bloud had beene puniſhed with bloud. But alas, it hath ben far otherwiſe; for diuers horrible murthers haue had their pardons by the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of their great friends, contrary to the expreſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of almighty God. Gen. 6. 9. Exo. 21. 12. Num. 35. 30. <note place="margin">Gen. 9. 6. Exod. 21. 12. Num 35. 30. 31</note> 31. Wherby it is come to paſſe, that the whole land is defiled
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:10737:217"/> with bloud, for as it is, Verſ. 33. <hi>Bloud defileth the Land, and the Land cannot be cleanſed of the bloud that is ſhed therein, but by the bloud of him that ſhed it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if wee ſpeake of the other inferiour kindes of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, wee ſhall finde, that not onely ſome few perſons, but euen the whole body of the people is guilty of this ſinne; for to ſpeake firſt of the murther of the hart, how doth it abound <note place="margin">Of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Heart.</note> amongſt vs in the ſeuerall kinds thereof? for how common is vnjuſt anger without a cauſe? inueterate malice, whereby one beareth to another ſuch hatred, that they will not ſo much as ſpeak to them for long time together; yea and rather then they will forgiue injuries, depriue themſelues of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the ſeale of their ſaluation? ſpightfull enuie, whereby one is vexed at the proſperitie of another, &amp; no leſſe grieued at the ſight of their neighbors good, then in the ſenſe of their own euil. So how doth deſire of taking priuate reuenge bear ſway in mens harts, inſomuch that men think it a diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their courage, and a great diſgrace to them, if they put vp an injurie? how doe men diſdaine and diſpiſe one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, if they come neere them in place, apparrell or account, whom they eſteeme their inferiours? what rejoycing is there in other mens harmes, eſpecially if they enuie their ſtate or beare them any ſecret grudge? when was there in any age the like crueltie in the harts of men, whereby they are not onely reſtrained from doing good one to another in their greateſt extremities, but moued alſo to hurt and oppreſſe one another when they haue opportunitie? when were men ſo eagerly diſpoſed to entertaine diſcord and contention, vvhen but the leaſt ſhew of an occaſion is offred? by all which it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth; how the murther of the heart aboundeth.</p>
               <p>The like may be ſaid of the murther of the Tongue; for <note place="margin">Of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Tongue.</note> rayling, chiding and reuiling is to be heard in euery corner, for euery trifle one miſcalling another by reprochfull names; and out of the malice of their hearts, men are ready to vtter for euery light cauſe, ſuch poyſoned words, as tend to their diſgrace and ruine? how ready are the moſt to deride and ſcoffe one another with bitter frumps, thinking that they
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:10737:218"/> haue much commended their wits, when they haue taunted one another with byting jeſts? what back-biting, and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering aboundeth in euery houſe, where the continuall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of mens talke, both at their table, and in their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie communication, is the faults and imperfections of their neighbours, yea, ſometimes of their moſt familiar friends? by all which it is manifeſt that the moſt men are guilty of the murther of the tongue.</p>
               <p>Neyther are the greateſt part amongſt vs to be excuſed <note place="margin">Of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Hands.</note> of the murther of the Hands: for although for feare of the Law, the moſt be reſtrayned from actuall murther, yet how many haue offred violence againſt the perſon of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, by quarrelling and fighting, hurting and wounding of their bodyes, thinking this to bee a ſmall or no ſinne at all, if they doe not take away their liues?</p>
               <p>So that if the Lord ſhould contend with vs, and arraigne vs before his iudgement ſeate; vve muſt generally plead guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and put our ſelues wholy vpon the doome of Gods infinite mercy.</p>
               <p>The fift ſinne wherof the Iſraelites are indited and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, is Stealing, of which the whole people of this land is guilty many vvayes. For firſt, if vve ſpeake of the higheſt degree of this ſinne, the naturall diſpoſition of this people is <note place="margin">That the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this land are much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> ſo inclinable hereunto, that it doth not vndeſeruedly beare the brand and reproach of this vice amongſt other nations. And in truth amongſt our ſelues vve haue great experience hereof: for howſoeuer theft is puniſhed ſeuerely in this land by death it ſelfe, yet the moſt of our able poore, if they bee of a baſe minde giue themſelues to begging, and thoſe who are of more ſpirit and courage, chooſe rather to rob and ſteale then to liue by their honeſt labours.</p>
               <p>But howſoeuer many may plead not guilty in reſpect of <note place="margin">Of the theft of the Heart.</note> this higheſt degree of theft, by reaſon of their ſufficiencie of maintenance, or feare of puniſhment; yet the other kindes of Theft, which are not puniſhed by humaine lawes, abound amongſt vs: as firſt, the Theft of the Heart, diſcontented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with mens owne eſtates; and couetouſneſſe, whereby
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:10737:218"/> they deſire by vnlawfull meanes to get vnto themſelues the wealth of other men, doth as much abound in this nation, as amongſt any people of the world. And hereby the ſeede of Gods word and all ſpirituall graces are exceedingly choaked, all holy duetyes of pietie and Chriſtianitie neglected, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of the poore and all works of mercy omitted, and the contrary vices vnmeaſurably increaſed.</p>
               <p>Come from the theft of the hart, to the theft which is in <note place="margin">Of oppreſſion.</note> fact, both through violence and deceipt, and we ſhal find our ſelues entred into an Ocean without eyther bottome or end: for where amongſt any ciuill people was euer ſeene the like tyrannicall oppreſsion, whereby the rich and mighty eate vp the weake and needy as the greater fiſhes deuoure the leſſe? when was there euer heard of the like exactions, impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, inhaunſement of rents to ſuch vnreaſonable rates, that poore men can not with the ſweat of their browes earne their bread? ſuch delaying, if not peruerting of juſtice for friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and reſpect of perſons? In what age of the world was there ſuch corruption in courts and Offices, ſuch inhaunſing of fees, ſuch extortion and intollerable pilling, proling and bribing? When did euer the Lawyers ſo flouriſh by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſpoyle, by deceipt and impoſtures, protractions of ſuites, defending injury and faſhood, betraying the cauſe of the innocent, like theeues contending one with another in counterfaite ſtrife, who ſhall haue the true mans purſe.</p>
               <p>Neyther is the ſtate of the miniſtery to be acquitted of <note place="margin">Theft of the Miniſtery to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the people.</note> this crime of Theft; for how many is there in this land, which liue vpon the common ſpoyle of the Pariſh, performing no duety for it? how many vnprofitable Drones, who eate the honie and neuer labour? ſome becauſe they cannot by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their inſufficiency &amp; ignorance, which are thoſe dumb dogs, of which the Prophet ſpeaketh, which not being able <note place="margin">Eſa. 56. 10.</note> to barke, betray the flocke into the jawes of the rauenous Wolfe: ſome through idleneſſe, becauſe they will not take paines, prizing their owne ſweate at a higher rate, then the precious ſoules of all thoſe which are committed to their charge: ſome through couetouſnes, adding liuing vnto liuing,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:10737:219"/> and ſo become negligent Non-reſidents, who feede them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues but ſtarue the people, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And as the miniſters offend by defrauding their flocks of <note place="margin">Theft of the people towards the Miniſters.</note> that ſpirituall foode which ſhould nouriſh them to euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life; ſo alſo doe the people generally in the land, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in this Citie, defraud their Miniſters of that ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent maintenance, which both by the Lawes of God and of the land are due vnto them: ſome by might &amp; force, ſome by deceiptfull conueyances, crafty colluſions, and other vnjuſt and fradulent courſes; which although men in their carnall ſecurity can ſlightly paſſe it ouer, yet let them bee aſſured that if euer they come vnto any ſenſe of ſinne, it will lye heauy vpon their conſciences, that they haue thus defrauded their miniſters, and in them God himſelfe.

               <p>And theſe with many other kindes of theft are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Of theft by vſury, buying and ſelling.</note> vſually in this land in ordinary dealing out of contract, beſides which, there are innumerable kindes of theft com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in contracts; as that legall theft of Vſury, vnder cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of lending, which now (eſpecially in this citie) is growne into ſuch a common trade, that if there were a Corporation made of thoſe who chiefly liue by this profeſsion, it would exceed in number the greateſt Company in the City. The like theft is vſually committed in buying and ſelling; for what innumerable deceipts are vſed in our times by men of this profeſsion? what falſe lights? what vnequall meaſures, and deceiptfull waights? what corrupt and bad wares? what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt in ouer-prizing them aboue their double value? what facing, lying, ſwearing, forſwearing and ouer-reaching? in which reſpects theſe profeſsions, may well keepe their old names of Crafts and Myſteryes, ſeeing almoſt euery ſhop is now become a Schoole of deceipt and falſhood, in which there are ſo many hidden ſubtilties, ſo many vnknowne ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecies, and ſubtle turnings and windings, that in their dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings there is not onely fraude, but euen a Myſterie of deceipt.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I briefly poynted at ſome kindes of theft commonly practiſed in this land; the which if I ſhould relate
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:10737:219"/> in al the particulars thereof, the very names of the diuers ſorts of this ſin, would be ſuffficient to fill a volume. But this which hath beene ſayd is inough to prooue that by this ſinne of Theft we haue juſtly deſerued, that the Lord ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with vs, and inflict vpon vs his fearefull judgements and moſt grieuous puniſhments.</p>
               <p>The laſt ſinne laid to the Iſraelits charge is Adulterie, with which filthyneſſe this land was neuer ſo much deſiled <note place="margin">That the land is exceedingly polluted with Adulterie.</note> as in theſe times, ſo that, if wee could plead not guilty in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the former crimes, yet this ſinne of vncleanneſſe were ſufficient in it ſelfe alone, to cauſe this land in Gods juſt wrath, to vomit out her inhabitants, who haue thus wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly <note place="margin">Leu. 18. 25. 27</note> defiled it. For to ſay nothing of the inward vncleannes of the heart, of which the Lord alone and mens conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are the witneſſes and iudges; How many are there whoſe whoredomes are written in their for-heads, and who carrie their adulterie, betweene their breſts? How many are there who commit the adulterie of the tongue, whileſt they take their cheefe delight in ribauld and obſceane ſpeaches, rotten and filthy communication? How many is there who commit the adultery of the eare, whilſt with pleaſing delight they attentiuely liſten to baudie jeſts, and are neuer merrier then when they are in the companie of filthy ribaulds? how many commit the adulterie of the eyes, whilſt they are ſo far from making with <hi>Iob</hi> a couenant with their eyes, that they <note place="margin">Iob. 31. 1.</note> wil not laſciuiouſly looke vpon a woman, that they purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly open them that they may take full view of obſceane ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and frequent thoſe places where they may moſt glut their adulterous eyes with wanton ſpectacles? How many openly profeſſe their inward vncleanneſſe of heart, by their immodeſt attire, wanton &amp; eſſeminate apparell, and by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open to the common view their naked breaſts, as though it were a bill affixed to the doore poſt, to ſignifie to the paſſers by, that within that place dwelleth an vncleane hart, &amp; that whoſoeuer wil may there buy honeſtie &amp; chaſtitie at an eaſie rate? Yea how many are there in this land, who giue themſelues ouer to all manner of vncleannes and adulterie
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:10737:220"/> in the higheſt degree, ſpending both their ſtrength and whole eſtates vpon filthie harlots, euen till they rot with loathſome diſeaſes, and haue brought themſelues to vtter beggerie? The which adulterous filthines the more raigneth, becauſe the Magiſtrates doe (if not altogether wincke at it) yet ſo ſlightly puniſh it, as though they jumped with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in iudgement, that it is but a veniall ſinne, which may be well tollerated; or as though the multitude of offenders did priuiledge the ſinne, and take away all hope of reformation, the guilty which ſhould be puniſhed, exceeding the number of the innocent who ſhould ſee them puniſhed.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I ſhewed, that the people &amp; inhabitants of this land, are in moſt haynous manner guilty of all theſe ſins, whereof the Iſraelits are here conuicted and condemned; the which we haue alſo fearefully aggrauated by the ſame &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other circumſtances, for they are not ſeldome committed &amp; in few places, but they are come to a common cuſtome &amp; vſuall faſhion, in euery corner of the Realme, and eſpecially in this Citie; there is no modeſtie or moderation in commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them, but men breake out, and like vnrulie beaſts will bee contayned by no fence; for neither Gods infinite goodneſſe, his meruailous mercie, nor his innumerable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, ſo bounteouſly beſtowed vpon this country will reſtrain them from committing of theſe ſinnes; no nor yet the curſe of his law, the feareful denunciation of his heauy judgements, ſo often ſounding in our eares, his fatherly admonitions and gentle chaſtizements, where-with we haue diuers times ben exerciſed. Yea ſo barbarouſly bould are men growne in their ſinnes, that the more diligently the Lord vſeth all good meanes to ſtop them in their wicked courſes, the more their vnruly luſts ſwell, &amp; violently breake downe the bankes of modeſtie, pietie, iuſtice, and the feare of God; and ſo with an vnreſiſtable ſloud of wickednes ouerflow the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; the more carefully the Lord applyeth vnto them ſuch ſoueraigne ſalues as might cure the wounds of ſin, the more deſperate they are in plucking them off againe, that they may rot in their corruptions; the more meanes is vſed to ſtay
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:10737:220"/> the infection of this contagious plague, the more it ſpreadeth it ſelfe ouer the whole country. And as theſe ſinnes abound in innumerable numbers, ſo they are haynous and bloudy in reſpect of their qualitie, being committed in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of their ſeuerall kindes: ſo that Gods Miniſters in our times, may juſtly complaine of the inhabitants of our land, that thoſe ſinnes of ſwearing, lying, killing, &amp;c. are vſually committed amongſt them, that like beaſts, they violently <hi>breake out, and bloud toucheth bloud.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereof it neceſſarily followeth, that ſeeing we abound in theſe ſinnes, and will not be reclaymed from them; ſeeing the Lord hath often allured vs by his innumerable benefits, by his ſweet promiſes, by his fatherly admonitions; and often terrified vs by his ſeuere threatnings, &amp; fearefull judgements of famine and dearth, ſickneſſe and peſtilence, and yet there is no amendment and reformation; that we can expect no other but that the Lord will bring this land to vtter deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and deſolation; vnleſſe we labour to preuent theſe heauie puniſhments by turning vnto him by ſpeedy and vnfayned repentance. For the Lord taketh that courſe with vs, which we take with our children and ſeruants, firſt he contayneth vs in his feare and obedience, by his gracious benefits; then if wee notwithſtanding liue in ſinne hee admoniſheth and threatneth vs, and if this will not reclaime vs, then he correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and puniſheth vs; but if theſe often inflicted are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileable, but that with full reſolution wee will deſperately runue on in our wicked courſes, then he will reject and caſt vs off, thruſt vs out of his familie, withdraw from vs all ſignes of his fauour, and giue vs ouer to bee vtterly deſtroyed with thoſe plagues which duely attend vpon ſuch deſperate ſins.</p>

               <p>The puniſhment it ſelfe here threatned, is the vtter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and deſolation of the land, by warre and the vſuall companion thereof dearth and famine; the which is moſt liuely and emphatically expreſſed in diuers metaphoricall and hyperbolicall ſpeeches, the which I will expound as they lye in order.</p>
               <p>And firſt here is expreſſed the cauſe of their puniſhment, then the puniſhment it ſelfe; the cauſe of their puniſhment, in this word, <hi>Therefore,</hi> that is, becauſe all manner of ſinne both of omiſsion and commiſsion doth abound in the land, and the people is deſperately reſolued to ruſh into all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wickedneſſe, notwithſtanding all thoſe meanes which I haue vſed to reclaime them, and euen are now growne to a cuſtome and habite of ſinning; therefore I will forbeare them no longer, ſeeing they giue no hope of their reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but will preſently execute my fearefull judgements amongſt them, till they be vtterly deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>The puniſhment it ſelfe is firſt expreſſed, and then am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified, it is expreſſed in two borrowed ſpeaches; the firſt in theſe words, <hi>the land ſhall mourne:</hi> As though he ſhould ſay, becauſe the people will not mourne for their ſinnes, euen the land it ſelfe ſhall mourne, and as it were ſigh &amp; groane vnder the heauy burthen of my puniſhments. So that hereby hee implyeth their ſtubberne rebellion, impenitencie, and hardneſſe of hart, in that the brute and ſenſeles earth would bee ſooner affected and touched with the feeling of Gods judgements, then the more ſenſeleſſe inhabitants; and alſo the greatneſſe of the puniſhment, which ſhould be ſo ſharpe that it would giue ſenſe to the ſenſeles creatures.</p>
               <p>The judgement it ſelfe is deſtruction and deſolation, by warre &amp; famine, whereby the inhabitants of the land ſhould be deſtroyed and ſwept away, and all the goodly ornaments of the earth, as the pleaſant Orchards &amp; gardens, the fruitfull
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:10737:221"/> fields and vinyards, ſhould bee vtterly waſted and ſpoyled: ſo that now the good mother earth ſhould like <hi>Rachell</hi> ſpend her time in mourning for her children, becauſe they were not, and like a deſolate captiue ſpoyled of all her riches and percious ornaments lament her paſſed loſſe and preſent miſerie. The meaning therefore of theſe words is this, that the earth ſhall become barraine and fruitleſſe, and and ſhall be ſtripped and ſpoyled of all her inhabitants, and ſo become a vaſt and diſolate wilderneſſe, neither inhabited by men, nor adorned with her beautifull fruits, as it were with her prinely coate of diuerſe coullours: for as the earth which is inhabited by a flowriſhing people, and decked and adorned with her plenteous fruits, is ſaide to reioyce laugh and ſing, Pſal. 96 12. <hi>Let the fielde bee ioyfull and all that is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 96. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>in it, let the trees of the wood then reioyce.</hi> Vnto which the Prophet Eſay alludeth Chap. 35. 1. 2. <hi>The waſt ground ſhall</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſay. 35. 1. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>bee glad and flouriſh as a Roſe. It ſhall flouriſh abundantly and ſhall greatly reioyce.</hi> So it is ſaid to mourne and weepe when it is diſ-peopled, and laid waſt &amp; deſolate, like a wilderneſſe. So Eſay 33. 9. <hi>The earth mourneth and fainteth, Libanon is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed and hewen downe, Sharon is like a wilderneſſe</hi> &amp;c. Ier. <note place="margin">Eſay 33. 9. Ier. 4. 27. 28.</note> 4. 27. 28. <hi>The whole land ſhall bee deſolate, therefore ſhall the earth mourne.</hi> Ioel. 1. 10. <hi>The field is waſted, the land mourneth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ioel. 1. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>for the corne is deſtroyed</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And thus the land mourned: firſt when as it was waſted by <hi>Tilgath-Pilneeſer</hi> King of Aſsiria, who led away two Tribes and a halfe captiue as appeareth, 1. Chron. 5. 26. <note place="margin">1. Chro. 5. 26.</note> but much more when as it was vtterly ouerthowne and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by <hi>Salmaneſer,</hi> of which wee may read, 2. Kings. 17 <note place="margin">2. King. 17.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly it is ſaide, that euerie one that dwelleth in the land ſhall bee cut off, the word is ſhall languiſh, or faint through weakeneſſe; whereby hee ſignifieth that howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the people would not mourne for ſinne, yet the Lord would make them mourne vnder his puniſhments, and that ſo greatly, that they ſhould euen languiſh and faint in their ſorrow and heauines, hauing no appearance of any comfort.</p>
               <p>Now theſe judgements are further aggrauated and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:10737:222"/> amplyfied, whereas it is ſaid that the vnreaſonable creatures, the inhabitants both of the ayre, earth, and water ſhall bee pertakers of the peoples miſerie, and bee ouerwhelmed in their ruine: and this ſheweth the greatneſſe of their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For as when the Lord would magnifie his bleſsing vpon mankinde, he ſaith, that he would keepe his Couenant not onely with <hi>Noah</hi> and his ſonnes, but with all liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <note place="margin">Gen. 9. 9. 10.</note> Foules, Cattle and Beaſts, becauſe theſe creatures were giuen vnto man for his profit and honeſt delight: ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe when hee would amplifie his irefull judgements, hee ſayth, that he would not onely deſtroy the people, but alſo ſpoyle them of all benefits whereby they might receiue any profit and comfort. And as to amplifie the greatneſſe of their puniſhment, and the grieuouſnes of their ſinne, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Iſraelites to deſtroy not onely the people of Iericho, but alſo their houſes, beaſts and cattle, ſiluer, gold, and all that belonged to them; ſo here he threatneth that for the ſame cauſes he would take the ſame courſe with the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites themſelues: that is, to ſhew his deteſtation of their horrible Treaſons and Rebellions, hee would not onely deſtroy them, but alſo their Land, and all that belonged vnto them.</p>
               <p>Yea, he ſaith his puniſhments ſhould extend to the fiſhes of the ſea, and this doth exceedingly amplifie the greatneſſe of his wrath; for euen in the generall Deluge the fiſhes were exempted from puniſhment, as if they had beene a nation of another world, who hauing no ſocietie with mankinde were not infected with the contagion of his ſinne: but now he ſhewed that his wrath was more inflamed, in that hee threatneth to make the fiſhes pertakers of mans miſery and puniſhments: not that indeede the Lord was purpoſed to catch the ſillie fiſh in the nets of his judgements, but onely vſed theſe Rhetoricall and Hyperbolicall amplyfications, that hereby hee might more feelingly affect the ſecure and hard hearted iſraelites, both with the ſence of their haynous ſinnes, and grieuous puniſhments.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of the words. The Doctrines <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>Therefore,</hi> that is, becauſe of their grieuous ſinnes the Land ſhall mourne and become deſolate: hence we obſerue, that the chiefe cauſe which maketh a land ſit mourning like a deſolate widdow, or a diſtreſſed mother, robbed of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and ſpoyled of all her comforts, is the ſin of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. Pſa. 107. 34. This brought an vniuerſall deluge ouer <note place="margin">Pſal. 107. 34.</note> the whole world: this brought downe fire and brimſtone vpon Sodome and Gomorrah: this cauſed the land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan to ſpue out her inhabitants.

The which threatnings were according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Deut. 28. 21. 22. and 63.</note> accompliſhed in their captiuitie, and finall deſolation.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this doctrine is, that thereby wee bee made <note place="margin">The vſes.</note> carefull to auoyde ſinne, ſeeing it bringeth the judgements of God not onely vpon our owne heads, but alſo vpon our country.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it teacheth vs, to what cauſe wee are chiefly to impute all manner of puniſhments, as warre, dearth, the peſtilence, namely to our ſinnes, as the chiefe and principall cauſe, whatſoeuer be the inferiour cauſes, meanes or inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Thirdly it confuteth their practiſe, who endeauour to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the flowriſhing ſtate of their Country, by Machiuili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an pollicies, falſhood, treacherie, wrongs and injuries, offred to their neighbours; by tollerating the ſinnes which ſhould be ſeuerely puniſhed, for feare of bringing daunger to the State, by exaſperating a multitude or great faction, or by any other wicked and vnlawfull meanes whatſoeuer: for how approueable ſo euer theſe courſes may ſeeme in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine <note place="margin">Exo. 1. 10.

Surely we muſt not chiefly truſt in humaine pollicies, and preuentions, or in the help of our bordering friends, for all this will be to little purpoſe, if we do not in the firſt place ſeeke reconciliation with God, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking our ſinnes, and turning vnto him by vnfained re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>The ſecond vſe ſerueth, for the comfort of thoſe that <note place="margin">God protects thoſe that mourne.</note> mourne in Sion, and daily bewaile both their owne ſins, and the ſinnes of their people: for ſuch are to know, that the Lord will giue them a ſpeciall priuiledge and protection, whereby they ſhall be protected from the common calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which he inflicteth vpon their nation; or if as members <note place="margin">Ier. 39. 16. 17.</note> of this great body pollitick, by reaſon of their communion, they neceſſarily pertake in their miſeries and afflictions, yet the Lord will ſo ſanctifie theſe croſſes vnto them, and will giue vnto them ſuch a meaſure of ſtrength, faith, patience, and comfort: that when vnrepentant ſinners, who neuer ſighed nor groned vnder the burthen of ſin, doe now grone and languiſh vnder the waight of puniſhment; they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, who vpon their vnfained repentance are aſſured of the forgiueneſſe of their ſinnes, ſhall not onely be patient, but alſo rejoyce in their tribulations, and their afflictions ſhall be vnto them, as a Serpent without a ſting.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, this ſerueth to refute the practiſe of thoſe, who when they are juſtly puniſhed for their ſinnes, in ſtead of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:10737:223"/> remouing the cauſe by repentance, doe adde ſinne vnto ſinne, by vſing wicked &amp; vnlawfull meanes for the remouing <note place="margin">The follie of thoſe who by ſinne labour to remoue pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment.</note> of their puniſhments; as for example going vnto Witches, Wizards and Sorcerers, vſing falſhoode and deceipt, iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and oppreſsion, that ſo they may remoue the burthen which God hath laid vpon them, vnto the ſhoulder of their neighbour: But ſuch are to know, that this is not the way to giue them eaſe, or to releaſe them of their afflictions, nay rather they are to expect, that as they adde ſinne vnto ſinne, ſo God will adde puniſhment vnto puniſhment; vntill they which refuſe to mourne for their ſinnes, faint and ſinke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his heauie iudgements.</p>
               <p>The third thing to be obſerued is the ſenſleſſe hardnes <note place="margin">The obdurate hardneſſe of mans hart.</note> of mans heart, and the ſecure impenitencie of our corrupt nature; whereby it commeth to paſſe, that neither Gods mercies nor judgements, will any whit affect vs, if the Lord giue vs ouer to our owne obdurate ſtubberneſſe; for euen when the ſenſleſſe and brutiſh creatures, are in their kinde affected, both with Gods mercies and judgements, only man remayneth without ſenſe and feeling. The heauens vaile their face &amp; ſhed forth their teares; the earth groneth &amp; ſhaketh; the waters roare &amp; ſwell; the beaſts, foules &amp; fiſhes mourne and hang down their heads, ſhewing their inward griefe, by that diuers language which God hath giuen them, when as the Lord is angry and layeth his heauie hand vpon them; onely man the chiefe rebell of the world ſmileth when God frowneth, and though he be ſomewhat touched with ſenſe of paine, yet hee ſorroweth onely becauſe hee is puniſhed, and not becauſe by his ſinnes hee hath deſerued puniſhment. And hence it is that the Lord ſometimes turneth his ſpeach from man, becauſe he hath no eares to heare, nor hart to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, nor ſenſe to feele and apprehend his mercies or judgements, vnto the ſenſeleſſe and brutiſh creatures; to note vnto vs that the ſenſeleſſe creatures are more ſenſible then a ſenſeleſſe man. So Eſay 1. 2. 3. Ier. 22. 29. <note place="margin">Eſay 1. 2. 3. Ier. 22. 29.</note>
               </p>
               <p>So it is ſayd in this place, that the land it ſelfe mourned, and that the beaſts, birds and fiſhes bore their part in this
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:10737:224"/> ſorrowfull ſong; but the Inhabitants of the Land are ſayde onely to haue languiſhed vnder the burthen of their miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and nothing is ſaid of any ſorrow or mourning vnder the heauie burthen of their ſinne. The like example we haue <note place="margin">Gen. 4. 13. Exod. 8. 8. 15 1 Kin. 13. 6. 33 Mat. 11. 16. 17 and 23. 37.</note> in <hi>Cain.</hi> Gen. 4. 13. In <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> Exod. 8. 8. 15. In <hi>Saul, Ieroboam.</hi> 1 King. 13. 6. 33. And in the people of the Iewes. Mat. 11. 16. 17. and 23. 37. But I ſhall not need to looke farre for examples to illuſtrate this point, ſeeing our owne experience doth too manifeſtly proue it: for howſoeuer like Bul-ruſhes we haue hanged downe our heads, whileſt the ſtorme of Gods judgements, did make vs bend and ſtoope, yet vvee are preſently ready to walk vnder the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of our ſinnes, with ſtiffe and ſtretched out necks, when we ſee that the ſtorme of Gods fury is a little ouerblowne.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this doctrine ſerueth: firſt, to teach vs that ſeeing naturally wee are hard hearted, and ſo ſenſeleſly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in our ſins, that we earneſtly labour for a broken hart and contrite ſpirit; and continually beg at the hands of God, that he will take away our ſtonie hearts, and giue vs hearts of fleſh, which will grieue and mourne when hee ſheweth any ſignes of his diſpleaſure, and euen like the hart of <hi>Ioſias</hi> melt at the hearing of the threatnings of his Law; grounding theſe our prayers vpon his owne gracious promiſes. Iere. <note place="margin">Iere. 32. 39. Ezech. 11. 19. and 36. 26.</note> 32. 39. Ezech. 11. 19. and 36. 26.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſerueth for the reproofe of carnall world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, who ſecurely goe on in their ſinnes, fooliſhly imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that they may repent when they liſt, and ſo receiue their pardon from God: but ſuch are to know that as it is a worke of greateſt neceſsity, ſo alſo of greateſt difficultie, for if the Lord leaue them to their owne hardneſſe of hart, as he juſtly may, ſeeing they haue abuſed his grace to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe, and his mercy and long ſuffering to impenitencie; well may they languiſh vnder puniſhment, yet they ſhall bee further off from true repentance and vnfayned mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for their ſinnes, then the ſenſeleſſe earth or brutiſh Creatures.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we are to obſerue, that the ſinne of man is not
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:10737:224"/> onely hurtfull and pernitious to himſelfe, but euen to the <note place="margin">Sin is perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to all the Creatures.</note> whole earth, and all the Creatures therein contained. In the Creation the Lord bleſſed the earth and her Inhabitants, but ſinne turned this bleſsing into a curſe. Gen. 3. 17. Gods <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 17.</note> bleſsing made it fruitfull, but mans ſinne made it barren, and in ſtead of Corne, Wine and Oyle, cauſed it to bring forth Thornes and Thiſtles, if it bee not, as it were watred with mans ſweate. Verſe. 18. 19. It brought a generall Deluge, <note place="margin">Verſe. 18. 19.</note> wherein not onely man, but all the Creatures periſhed. It turned Sodome and Gomorrah, which was like the garden of Eden, into a ſalt Marſh, and deſolate wildernes. It brought all thoſe plagues of Aegipt not onely vpon man, but vpon the beaſts likewiſe. In a word, it is the cauſe of all the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries which all the Creatures ſuffer, vnder which they <hi>grone and trauaile in paine together with vs,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 22.</note> Rom. 8. 22. from which with feruent deſire they waite to be deliuered, when man is freed from his ſinne, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. Verſe. 19. 20. 21. <note place="margin">Ver. 19. 20. 21</note>
               </p>
               <p>Neyther is this vnjuſt with God; that the creatures ſhould be puniſhed for the ſinne of man: ſeeing as man was not made for himſelfe but for God; ſo they were not made for themſelues but for the vſe of man: and therefore as they were to joy in his rejoycing; ſo to beare their part of griefe in his mourning and miſerie: like the ſeruants of Noble men, who are quelled in their Lords ruines, and though they are not guilty of their treaſons committed againſt their ſoueraigne prince, yet they are ouerthrowne in their eſtates &amp; pertakers in their puniſhments.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this doctrine is: firſt, to admoniſh vs, that when wee ſee the miſeries of any of the poore Creatures, as the barrenneſſe of the earth, the toyle, ſickneſſe and manifold infirmities of the beaſts, &amp;c. we be thereby put in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of our ſinnes, and be moued to bewayle them, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe not onely of our owne, but alſo of all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures miſerie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſerueth to reproue thoſe, who abuſe the poore creatures with tyrannical crueltie, and are ſo far from pitying
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:10737:225"/> them, in thoſe miſeries which our ſinnes haue inflicted vpon them, that they make ſeauen-fould greater the heauy burthen of their euils, through their barbarous vſage of them; like hard-harted and mercileſſe Lords, who ſeeing their ſeruant adjudged to death for their treaſons, in ſtead of pitying his puniſhment play themſelues the executioner, in cauſing him to dye by exquiſite torments, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing to bee obſerued is, that when the Lord exerciſeth his judgements vpon the creatures, when the <note place="margin">That wee are not lightly to paſſe ouer gods judgements in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted vpon the creatures.</note> Earth is ſmitten with barrenneſſe, ſpoyled of her fruits, and ſtripped of her goodly ornaments; when the waters aboue eyther drop not at all or in ſuch abundance that in ſtead of watring her, they drowne and ouer flow her, and when the beaſts and cattle periſh eyther by murraigne or famiſhment, wee are not lightly to paſſe theſe things ouer; but to eſteeme them as ſignes of Gods diſpleaſure conceiued for our ſinnes, and as ſo many ſummons whereby the Lord warneth vs to ſeeke reconciliation by true repentance, leſt we be ouertaken by his more fearefull judgements. Leuit. 26. 14. 15. &amp;c. <note place="margin">Leu. 26. 14. 15 Deut. 28. 15. 16.</note> Deut. 28. 15. 16. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof ſerueth for the reproofe of thoſe who are nothing affected with gods judgements vpon the creatures, no further then themſelues haue a ſenſible feeling of their euills, ſo that if in the time of dearth and famine they feele no want they are neuer thereby put in minde eyther of Gods anger or of their owne ſinnes, nor touched with thoſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries vnder which the brute creatures mourne, nor with any compaſsion or fellow-feeling of their neighbours wants.</p>

               <p>The ſinne whereof they are accuſed, is their impatiencie of rebuke, for howſoeuer they abounded in all manner of ſin yet they could not indure, that eyther Gods Prophets or other his faithfull ſeruants ſhould admoniſh or reprooue them for their wickedneſſe. And this was a manifeſt ſigne, that they were deſperately reſolued to continue in their ſins, and were now paſt all hope of recouerie in this ſickneſſe of their ſoules, ſeeing they would not heare the Phiſition, nor regard his counſaile, nor follow his directions, nor vſe any meanes for their recouery; but caſt the potions againſt the walls and pull of the plaiſters applied for their curing, and throw them in the Phyſitions face. The like example wee haue Eſay. 30. 9. 10. 11. Where the Prophet complaineth that the Iſraelits <hi>were a rebellious people, lying children, who</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſay. 30. 9. 10. 11.</note>

               <p>Yea but it is not ſaid here, that the people forbid the Prophet to admoniſh and rebuke them, but the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.

                  <hi>that which is holie to dogs, &amp;c.</hi> And ſuch were this people of whom the Lord ſaith; <hi>Yet let none rebuke nor reprooue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> As though hee ſhould haue ſaid; although their ſinnes are ſo many and haynous, that they deſerue continuall
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:10737:226"/> reproofe and reprehenſion, yet let no man rebuke them, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is to no purpoſe, they being ſo deſperately giuen ouer to all wickedneſſe, that they are become altogether impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of any reproofe.</p>
               <p>And this is plainely expreſſed in the words following. <hi>For thy people are as they that rebuke the Prieſt.</hi> that is, they are ſuch as indeed doe rebuke the Prieſt, for ſo this word <hi>As,</hi> is ſometimes taken abſolutely. Hoſ. 5. 10. <hi>The princes of Iudah are as they that remoue the Land-mark.</hi> Ioh. 1. 14. <hi>And we ſaw the glory thereof, as the glory of the onely begotten ſonne.</hi> Where he aggrauateth their ſinne, ſhewing that they were not onely impatient of reproofe, but which was more, they contended with their teachers, and rebuked thoſe by whom they were rebuked. So that they were not onely impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to heare any reprehenſion, but alſo were growne ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent and impudent in their ſinnes, that they durſt defend them againſt their reprouers, and were ready to challenge them, that they more offended in cenſuring their faults, then themſelues in committing them.</p>
               <p>And this is ſignified by this phraſe of <hi>rebuking the prieſt,</hi> where by Prieſt we are to vnderſtand all whoſoeuer haue a lawful calling from god, to deliuer his word, whether, Prieſt, Prophet or other Miniſters; but he maketh mention of the Prieſt, becauſe ordinarily to him was committed the office of teaching, exhorting, and comforting Gods people, as alſo of rebuking, accuſing, and condemning the obſtinate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious.</p>
               <p>Now this did exceedingly aggrauate their ſins, in that they durſt thus inſolently &amp; preſumptuouſly oppoſe themſelues againſt Gods Prieſts, returning reproofe for reproofe, and inverting and peruerting Gods owne order and ordinance, who appointed the Prieſts in the Miniſterie of the Word, to rebuke their ſins, and that freely without checke and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulement for their juſt reprehenſions.

                  </label> which ariſe out of them are theſe: firſt, we may obſerue that <note place="margin">That it is a ſigne of Gods wrath when he ſtoppeth the mouthes of his Miniſters.</note> it is a ſigne of Gods heauy diſpleaſure and approaching ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and that his purpoſe is to giue ouer ſuch vnto a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate ſenſe, to runne on in their ſinnes without hope of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment to eternall perdition, when as hee ſtoppeth the mouthes of his faithfull ſeruants, and will not ſuffer them to reproue and reprehend them for their ſinnes; ſo here when he was determined to puniſh the Iſraelites with Captiuitie, he reſtraineth his Prophets, from rebuking and reprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, though they abounded in all ſinne. And Ezech. <note place="margin">Ezech. 3. 26.</note> 3. 26. becauſe the people were deſperately giuen ouer to worke wickedneſſe, hee ſtoppeth the Prophets mouth and forbiddeth him to rebuke them. When the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies ſhewed their malicious ſpite againſt Chriſt and his truth, our Sauiour would not inſtruct them but in Parables, and reſtraineth his Diſciples from reprouing them for their malicious forwardneſſe.

                  <hi>be the blinde leaders of the blinde, &amp;c.</hi> The reaſon hereof is, firſt becauſe hee would not haue his ſeruants looſe their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in admoniſhing and reprouing thoſe who are ſo reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in their wickedneſſe, that there is no hope of amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And ſecondly; becauſe he is purpoſed to let them pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in their ſinnes, and therefore reſtraineth them of the meanes, whereby they might eſcape his judgements, or elſe ſo giueth them ouer to the hardneſſe of their hearts, that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:10737:227"/> they doe not profit by them, as we may ſee in the example of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Elies</hi> ſonnes. 1 Sam. 2. 25. And <hi>Amaziah.</hi>

               <p>The vſe hereof ſerueth firſt to perſwade all that are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues <note place="margin">Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes neceſſary</note> religious, that they be ready to reproue and admoniſh all their brethren of their ſinnes, if they ſee any hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; for hereby they ſhall performe a worke moſt charitable in ſtopping them in their courſe of ſinne, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they incurre Gods wrath, and runne headlong to their owne perdition, and this duetie is injoyned.

               <p>Secondly, it teacheth all with patience to heare the word <note place="margin">We muſt pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently heare the word of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.</note> of admonion and reprehenſion, when they offend; and not onely patiently, but alſo thankfully; ſeeing it is a meanes to reſtraine from vs Gods wrath &amp; heauie judgements. It is a potion, which howſoeuer it is bitter, yet it helpeth to purge away the groſe humours of ſinne, and preſerueth from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death: It is a corraſiue indeed, but yet profitable, becauſe it draweth out the core of our corruptions: It may bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant at firſt, when we are awaked out of the ſweet ſleep of carnall ſecuritie, but wee ſhall haue little cauſe to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with him that hath rouzed vs vp ſeeing this ſleepe endeth in death.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it ſheweth the extreame folly of thoſe who rage <note place="margin">The folly of ſuch, who rage againſt thoſe who reproue them.</note> againſt Gods Miniſters, when they reproue and reprehend them for their ſinnes, thinking themſelues neuer worſe, then when they are vnder the cenſure of the word, and neuer bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at eaſe, then when they may ſleepe ſecurely in their ſins without reproofe. Such are ſicke of the ſpirituall Lethargie, they delight in this eaſie ſleepe that bringeth death, and cannot indure to be rouzed vp, though it be the onely meanes to preſerue life and recouer health.

               <p>The third thing to be obſerued is, that howſoeuer we are <note place="margin">To whom the dutie of admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition is to be performed.</note> injoyned in the Scriptures to admoniſh one another, yet this duety is not to be performed vnto all, neyther is this ſpirituall ſeede raſhly to be caſt in euery place, but onely in ſuch grounds, where in ſome probabilitie of reaſon, we may expect fruit. For if we know that they haue often ben admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed of their ſinnes, and are nothing bettered, but rather deſpiſe and ſcorne rebukes, wee are to let them alone, and leaue them to Gods judgements? for by reprouing ſuch we purchaſe ſhame and hatred. Prou 9. 7. 8. If we ſee that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <note place="margin">Pro. 9. 7. 8.</note> they haue had the meanes of their conuerſion, they continue wallowing in the filthy ſinck of ſinne, we are not to caſt theſe precious pearles before ſuch ſwine, leaſt they tread them vnder their beaſtly feete: If we ſee that they are deſperate Ruffians, which will ſnarle againſt our reproofes, and in the pride and malice of their hearts, bee ready to flye in the face of thoſe, who admoniſh them of their ſinnes, we are not to giue thoſe holy things to ſuch Ban-dogs, as our Sauiour hath taught vs. Mat. 7. 6. For as Chriſt would not <note place="margin">Math. 7. 6.</note> haue his word prophanely ſcorned, ſo he would not haue his ſeruants indangered, nor his ſpirituall Phyſitions to hazard their liues, in ſeeking to cure ſuch franticke Bedlems, whoſe diſeaſes are deſperate; but rather leaue them to be brought to the knowledge of themſelues, by the three-ſtringed whip of Gods judgements.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:10737:228"/>
               <p> But yet wee are not thus to take it as though onely thoſe <note place="margin">Who are to be reproued.</note> were to be admoniſhed and reproued, who ſhew ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable diſpoſition to amendement, and they to be let alone, who liue in their outragious ſinnes, and giue at firſt ſight no hope of reformation: for admonition and reproofe is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall meanes, ſanctified by God for their conuerſion, the hammer to batter their ſtony hearts, and the beſt tamer of theſe Lyons, Beares, Leopards and Cockatrices, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Eſa. 11. 4. 6. 7.

               <p>Laſtly, we may obſerue, that the Lord doth condemne <note place="margin">That it is deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with thoſe who juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reproue vs.</note> it as a ſigne of deſperate wickedneſſe in the people, when as being rebuked for their ſinnes, by Gods Prieſts, Prophets, and Miniſters, in ſtead of laying theſe admonitions to heart, that they may be reformed, they expoſtulate with them, caſt in their teeth reproaches, and challenge them of the like faults or greater, then thoſe which they lay to their charge. And thus dealt <hi>Dathan</hi> and his aſſociates, with <hi>Moyſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> Num. 16. <hi>Ahab</hi> with <hi>Elias.</hi> 1 King. 18. 17.

The reaſon is, becauſe it is an vtter ſubuerſion of Gods ordinance, when the people being rebuked, doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort reproofes vpon their teachers: as if the hand or foote ſhould take vpon them to guide the eye; the childe rebuke the father; the patient direct the Phyſition; the Scholler check his Scholemaiſter; or the ſheepe expoſtulate with the ſhepheard: beſides howſoeuer in reſpect of their perſons,

               </p>
               <p>The vſe hereof ſerueth to moue all men with patience to ſuffer themſelues to be directed by theſe ſpirituall guides; to be admoniſhed by theſe ſpirituall fathers, without expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; to be cured of theſe ſpirituall Phyſitions without mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring or repining, &amp;c. leaſt by croſsing Gods holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, they moue the Lord to take away from them theſe meanes of their conuerſion and giue them vp to a reprobate ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſerueth for the juſt reproofe of the people <note place="margin">Thoſe rebuked who reproue their teachers.</note> of this land, and eſpecially of this Citie, who are growne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that height of pride and inſolencie, that they will take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them to teach their teachers, and bring all that is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the rule and cenſure of their ſhallow conceipt: as alſo thoſe who when they heare their ſinnes reproued out of gods word, in ſtead of amending their wicked wayes, are ready to expoſtulate with their teachers, to reproue them for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes, and to caſt in their teeth, their faults &amp; imperfections.

The puniſhment is expreſſed in theſe words, <hi>thou ſhalt fall:</hi> the which is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor borrowed from ſuch, as being eyther blind or walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the darke, are ready to fall into the ditches and pits.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:10737:229"/> Whereby is ſignified that becauſe they loued darkneſſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then light, and erring in their owne wicked wayes would not indure to be directed and guided by the light of Gods word, but hated their guides and diſpiſed their admonitions, therefore they ſhould fall into the pit of Gods fearefull iudgements, and periſh therein both people and Prophets.</p>
               <p>Now theſe iudgements into which the Prophet ſaith the people ſhall fall, are as I take it properly to bee vnderſtood of thoſe temporary puniſhments, into which ſoone after they did fall; namely, the ſword, captiuitie and deſolation; howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it may well bee that vnder theſe as types may bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood their fall into gods ſpirituall judgements, death and eternall condemnation; when as the light of the Goſpell ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, and the ſunne of righteouſneſſe clearely ſhyning, they would not receiue the promiſed Meſsias; but as though they had beene ſtill in the darke or ſtarke blind, they ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at him as at a ſtone of offence, and ſo fell into the pit of eternall perdition, according to the Prophecies. Eſay. 8. <note place="margin">Eſay 8. 14. Luke 2. 34. Rom. 9. 32. 1 Cor. 1. 23.</note> 14. Luk. 2. 34. Which wee ſee accompliſhed. Rom. 9. 32. 1. Cor. 1. 23.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the cauſe why they fell into the pit of Gods judgements is implyed in this word <hi>Therefore,</hi> as it is fitly here tranſlated: whereby is ſignified, that becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed the light of Gods word and would not harken to his faithfull Prophets, nor ſuffer themſelues to bee guided by them, but contemned their admonitions, yea and inſolently rebuked their reprouers, chuſing rather to harken vnto falſe Prophets who ſeduced them and flattered them in their ſins; therefore running on in the wayes of darkneſſe like blinde people after blinde guided, they ſhould both fall into the pit of Gods judgements, the deepe pit of temporary puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the bottomleſſe pit of eternall deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the perſons againſt whom theſe puniſhments are threatned, are firſt more diſtinctly ſpecified, and after compriſed in one generall ſumme. They are ſpecified whereas he ſaith that both people and Prophets ſhould thus fall. The people are expreſſed in this word <hi>Thou:</hi> where he
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:10737:230"/> maketh an Apoſtrophe and conuerſion of his ſpeach to the people, and hauing ſpoken of them in the former Verſe, in the third perſon, hee now vſeth the ſecond for the greater emphaſis, that hee might point them out who were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by God vnto puniſhment, and the ſingular number as though hee would cull them out man by man. And this was juſt with God that this people who wilfully ſhut their eyes againſt the light of Gods truth, and deſpiſed his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruants admoniſhing them, ſhould be giuen vp of God to a reprobate ſenſe, to follow the deluſions of falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and to walke in their owne wicked wayes, vntill they fell into the pit of deſtruction.</p>
               <p>It is further ſaid, that their Prophets ſhould fall with them; by which wee are not to vnderſtand their true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who admoniſhed them of their ſinnes and ſo becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming guiltleſſe of their tranſgreſsions ſaued their owne ſoules, and were not pertakers with them in their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but their falſe and flattering Prophets, who ſoothed them in their ſins, and ſowed cuſhions vnder their elbowes that they might more ſecurely goe on in their wickedneſſe. And here alſo he vſeth the ſingular number indefinitely, for the greater emphaſis, as though hee ſhould ſay howſoeuer diuers may thinke that they ſhalbe exempted in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon puniſhment by their wit, learning, pollicie, authoritie, or fauour with the people, yet not one of them ſhall eſcape. And this was juſt with God that the falſe Prophets who had ſeduced the people ſhould being acceſſarie to their ſins bee pertakers in their puniſhments.</p>
               <p>Secondly hee ſaith, that hee will deſtroy their mother, whereby we are to vnderſtand the whole Common-wealth Sinagogue, and Church of the Iewes; which the Lord threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſo to ouer-turne and ruinate, that there ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine ſo much as an outward face of a kingdome, nor the glorious title of the Church, wherein they ſo much boaſted: as though hee ſhould ſay, my purpoſe is to deſtroy all and ſome; particular perſons, and the whole ſtate both of church and common-wealth, ſo as I will not leaue ſo much as your
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:10737:230"/> goodly ſhewes, and glorious titles, vnder which you ſhelter your ſelues from the ſtorme of Gods judgements, and ſo ſecurely liue in your ſinnes without repentance. Where the Lord vſeth the name of Mother, to comprehend the whole Synagogue of the Iſraelites, both to ſhew the grieuouſneſſe of the judgement, in that the Lord killed the damme toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with her young, and alſo that hee might more ſenſibly affect their ſtonie and ſecure hearts with compaſsionate griefe; ſeeing by their ſinnes they had not onely deſtroyed themſelues, but alſo their mother, who in reſpect of this neere alliance ought aboue all things in the world to be moſt deere vnto them.</p>
               <p>Now this fearefull judgement the Lord accordingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted vpon them, when as firſt he deſtroyed innumerable numbers of the Iſraelits, both by their ciuill diſſentions, and forraine invaſions; and afterwards when as the remnant which remained were carryed Captiue into Aſsiria, and the Aſsirians planted their Colonies in the Land of Iſraell, whereby all hope of reſtitution was vtterly cut off.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing expreſſed is, the time of theſe calamities, in theſe words, <hi>in the day,</hi> and <hi>in the night.</hi> The words are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginally, <hi>to day</hi> and <hi>to night,</hi> whereby he ſignifieth firſt, that their puniſhments ſhould be very ſodaine and ſpeedy: and ſecondly, that they ſhould be continuall, one following in the neck of another, as the day doth immediately follow the night. As though he ſhould ſay, I will ſpeedely deſtroy the people in their ſinnes, and although I do not preſently attach with my judgements the falſe Prophets, becauſe the people muſt beare the firſt brunt of the war; yet hauing done with the one, I will immediately begin with the other, vntill I haue made an end of all, becauſe all haue joyned together in this rebellion.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of the words. The Doctrines <label type="milestone">

Gods Miniſters are the ſpirituall Phyſitions, who cure thoſe who are diſeaſed with ſinne, by miniſtring vnto them the wholeſome preſeruatiues of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, and the bitter potions of reprehenſion &amp; rebuke: If therefore theſe medicines be applyed, there is hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie; but if the patient contemne the Phyſitions counſell, and refuſeth to take theſe wholeſome medicines, but rather hearkeneth to ſome vnskilfull Empericke, who promiſeth cure without any trouble to the patient; ſuch a one is neere death and deſtruction, becauſe he cannot be cured, as the wiſe man ſheweth.

               <p>The ſecond thing to be obſerued is, that not onely the <note place="margin">The Prophets who ſeduce the people ſhall periſh with them.</note> people who liue in wickedneſſe, but alſo the Prophets who ſeduce them, or boulſter them vp in their ſinnes, ſhall fall
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:10737:232"/> into the pit of Gods judgements in the day of his viſitation. So the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> threatneth <hi>Paſhur</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Imner</hi> the Prieſt, that becauſe hee had preached lies, he and <note place="margin">Ier. 20. 6. and 23. 31.</note> all that belonged to him ſhould dye in captiuitie. Ier. 20. 6. So the Lord threatneth, that in his wrath hee will come againſt the Prophets, which haue ſweete tongues ſeducing the people with pleaſing Lyes. Chap. 23. 31. So when the falſe Prophets bore the people in hand that they ſhould not ſerue the king of Babell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for this their ſinne in ſeducing the people, and the ſinne of the people in giuing credit rather to them then to the true Prophets, the Lord denounceth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction both againſt the Prophets and people, Chap. 27. <note place="margin">Ier. 27. 15. and 14. 14. 15. 16.</note> 15. See Chap. 14. 14. 15. 16. The Prophet <hi>Ezechiell</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe threatneth the falſe Prophets, that becauſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed peace, where the Lord denounced warre, &amp; played the dawbers, in couering the faults and ſinnes of the people with vntempered morter, that they and their worke ſhould both periſh. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 10. 14. And in generall the Lord deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered <note place="margin">Ezech. 13. 10. 14.</note> this denunciation by the ſame Prophet, that if the watchman ſeeing the ſword comming, did not giue the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple warning, nor admoniſh them of their wicked wayes, the wicked ſhould dye in their ſinnes, but their bloud ſhould be required of the watchmans hands. The reaſon hereof is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, <note place="margin">Ezech. 33. 8.</note> for if thoſe whom he hath appointed to be his ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors vnto the people liuing in their rebellion, that they may tell them of their ſinnes, and denounce his judgements, doe conſpire with the people againſt God, ſooth them in their ſinnes, and become the heraulds to proclaime Gods mercies, not caring to diſpleaſe God ſo they may pleaſe the people; the Lord in his juſtice can doe no leſſe but puniſh the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of the people, and the treacherous treaſon of ſuch ambaſſadours.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this doctrine ſerueth firſt to ſtirre vp Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters <note place="margin">Sinceritie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the Miniſters in Preaching. Col. 1. 10.</note> with all care and conſcience, to deliuer that ambaſſage which they haue receiued from God purely and ſincerely; not as men pleaſers but as the ſeruants of Ieſus Chriſt. Leaſt in ſeeking popular applauſe by not reprouing of ſinne, they
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:10737:232"/> cauſe both themſelues and the people to fall into the pit of Gods judgements in the day of his viſitation. 1. Kin. 22. 14. <note place="margin">1. Kin. 22. 14.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it teacheth the people, with all patience and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence to receiue the word of admonition and rebuke, as <note place="margin">Patience and reuerence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the people in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> being the meanes ſanctifyed by God, to bring them to a ſight of their ſinnes and vnfayned repentance; that ſo both they and their miniſters may eſcape Gods juſtly deſerued wrath and vengeance. If one walking in a pleaſant way ſhould be admoniſhed by a friend, that if hee went forward he were in danger to fall into an hidden pit, or into an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſhment of enimies, though his walke were delightfull, who would not turne backe, and ſhew himſelfe thankefull to him from whom he had receiued ſuch a friendly admonition? but this is our caſe, we walke in the pleaſant wayes of ſinne, which lead vs into the pit of deſtruction? and cauſe vs to fall if wee goe forward in them, into the ambuſhment of our ſpirituall enimies, ſathan, hell, and condemnation: who therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admoniſhed to deſiſt in this daungerous, though plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing courſe, would not willingly turne backe, and render thanks vnto him, by whoſe admonition he was preſerued from ſuch imminent daunger.</p>
               <p>Laſtly this ſerueth for the iuſt terrour of all time-ſeruers, <note place="margin">Terrour for time-ſeruers who ſooth men in their ſinnes.</note> and men pleaſers, who will not or dare not deliuer Gods ambaſſage, nor admoniſh or reproue great perſonages for their ſinnes, for feare of incurring their diſpleaſure, or looſing thoſe rewards which they hope to receiue by ſoothing them in all their wicked wayes; in this reſpect worſe then <hi>Balaam</hi> himſelfe, who howſoeuer hee <hi>loued the reward of iniquitie,</hi> yet proteſted that he would not ſpeake any other thing, then that which God put in his mouth, for to gaine thereby all the wealth of <hi>Balaac;</hi> whereas they for a farre leſſe matter, ſpeake the cleane contrarie; commending where God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth; bleſsing where he curſeth, and curſing where he bleſſeth; proclayming peace, where he denounceth warre; and giuing a <hi>Quietus est,</hi> and generall acquittance, to thoſe whom the Lord for their great &amp; grieuous debts is ready to arreſt and attach: ſuch although for a time they get the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:10737:233"/> fauour of great perſonages, and flowriſh in the world, yet they are in a moſt miſerable condition, ſeeing the time will come, when as the Lord will cauſe his judgements to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them, as being traitours to his Majeſtie, in deliuering a quite contrary ambaſſage to that which they receyued from him; Traytours vnto their Prince and Country, in that they haue not admoniſhed them of imminent daungers, but ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing them in the pleaſing wayes of ſinne, haue encouraged them to goe forward in them, till they fall into the pit of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; and traytours to their owne ſoules, in that as they accompany them in their ſinnes, ſo alſo they ſhall accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them in their puniſhments.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we are to obſerue, that God will inflict puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <note place="margin">God ſeuerely puniſheth thoſe who contemne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition.</note> ſpeedely, continually, and one in the neck of another, vpon that people who deſpiſe admonitions, and are impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to heare rebukes: for when his ſoueraigne ſalues of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction will not heale them, nor his ſharpe coraſiues of rebuke keepe them from putrifaction and rottenneſſe, what remaineth, but that with the ſword of vengeance hee ſhould cut them off? And thus the Lord puniſheth contemners of his word; by ſuffering them to fall into errours and hereſies; and by giuing them vp to ſtrong deluſions, and to beleeue <note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2. 11.</note> lyes; by giuing them ouer to a reprobate ſenſe, to runne on in their wicked wayes, without check or ſtop; and laſtly, by bringing vpon them calamitie vpon calamitie, and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vpon puniſhment, till they bee vtterly deſtroyed and cut off. An example whereof wee haue in the Churches of Iſraell and Iuda, in <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> in <hi>Ahab,</hi> and many others.</p>
               <p>The vſe is, that if we would eſcape theſe manifold and <note place="margin">A perticular Church may ceaſe to be a true Church.</note> continuall calamities, we ſubmit our ſelues to be ruled by the ſcepter of the word, and bee as well contented to heare our ſelues admoniſhed of our faults, and reproued for out ſinnes, as to heare of comfort when we doe well, and of the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes of the Goſpll, when we haue turned from our ſinnes by vnfayned repentance.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we may obſerue, that howſoeuer the Catholike and inviſible Church of Chriſt, cannot faile and ceaſe to be
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:10737:233"/> his Church, yet a particular and viſible Church may; as we ſee in the example of the Church of Iſraell in this place. For when Idolatry, Will-worſhip, and humaine traditions thruſt out Gods pure and ſincere worſhip, when the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the word ceaſeth, and in ſtead thereof lyes are pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and imbraced; when the Sacraments are neglected, or wholy corrupted and depraued, ſuch aſſemblies whether particular or nationall, ceaſe to be the Church of Chriſt, and begin to be the Synagogue of Sathan.</p>
               <p>This heauy judgement Chriſt alſo threatneth againſt the Church of the Iewes. Mat. 21. 43. <hi>The kingdome of God</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 21. 43.</note>

                  <hi>thy Candleſtick out of his place, except thou amend,</hi> that is, I will tranſlate my Church from thee to ſome other nation. The fearefull execution of all which threatnings, we ſee at this day, for all thoſe famous Churches mentioned in the Scriptures, are vtterly periſhed, and become both in their ſoules and bodyes the Vaſſals of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> the Turke, <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and the ſeauen headed beaſt the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt of Rome.</p>
               <p>The vſe which we are to make hereof is, firſt, to admoniſh <note place="margin">Wee muſt not reſt in outward priuiledges.</note> vs that we doe not flatter our ſelues in thoſe glorious titles and goodly priuiledges, which yet through Gods mercy we injoy, in that we are the Church of God, and haue his word and Sacraments amongſt vs. For if we ſecurely reſt in theſe titles and priuiledges, and thinke it ſufficient that we haue the kingdome of God amongſt vs, but bring forth no fruits of it, nor liue like his ſubjects, but the vaſſals of Sathan; this kingdome ſhall likewiſe be taken from vs, and giuen to a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which will bring forth the fruits thereof. If we continue in our ſinnes, looſe our firſt loue, and will not repent and amend, our Candleſtick ſhall be remoued; if wee remaine ſtubbornely rebellious, and will not endure admonition and rebuke, the Lord will deſtroy our mother, as here he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the Iſraelites, and make vs like the Churches of the Iewes and Aſia.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:10737:234"/>
               <p> Secondly it ſerueth for the confutation of the Papiſts, <note place="margin">The Church of Rome no true Church of God.</note> who inveſt their mother the Church of Rome in the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ornaments of her anceſters, grace her with their titles &amp; and priuiledges, and aduance her aboue others in the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious chaire of antiquitie. But ſeeing ſhe hath fallen from her firſt loue, and repenteth not, ſeeing ſhe hath voluntarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded her ſelfe out of Chriſts kingdome, and will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to be gouerned by the ſcepter of his word, but hath ſeruilely ſubmitted her ſelfe to Antichriſt, and is content to take his marke and beare his yoke: ſeeing ſhe hath baniſhed out of her Gods pure worſhip, the miniſterie of his word, and hath wholy corrupted and depraued his Sacraments, and now worſhippeth Idols, Saints, Angels, their breadden God of the Aulter; and if they worſhip the true God at all yet not according to his word, but after their owne wils in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine inuentions and traditions; and ſeeing they are ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately reſolued to continue in theſe their ſinnes that they will here of no admonition, but rebuke their reprouers, yea perſecute vnto the death all that labour to reclaime them, it is hereby manifeſt, that long agoe they are ceaſed to be the ſpouſe of Chriſt, and are now become an infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous harlot, euen the whoore of Babilon, they are no more the Church of God but the Sinagogue of Sathan, and ſlaues of Antichriſt. For if the Church of Iſraell who had Gods law, couenant, promiſes, and all royall prerogatiues, cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bee the Church, when as they did wholy degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and abandoned Gods pure worſhip, and if thoſe famous Churches, mentioned in the new teſtament, planted by the Apoſtles themſelues, making the like apoſtacy were ſubiect to the ſame puniſhment, then what can priuiledge the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Church of Rome (which is wholy degenerate from her anceſtours, both in puritie of doctrine and holyneſſe of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and conuerſation) from the like fearefull judgement; ſeeing ſhe hath matched them, yea and exceeded them all in deſperate and audatious wickedneſſe?</p>

Now followeth the third bill and ſentence, which from the 6. verſe to the 11. verſe are intermixed one with the other: wherein hee inditeth, accuſeth, and condemneth the whole body of the Church and common wealth, both prieſts and people; and this he doth firſt joyntly, and after more particularly he ſetteth downe both the ſinnes and puniſhments of the Prieſts and people.

                  <hi>Becauſe thou haſt refuſed knowledge, I will alſo refuſe thee, that thou ſhalt bee no Prieſt to mee: and ſeeing thou haſt forgotten the Law of thy God, I will alſo forget thy children.</hi> In which <note place="margin">Expoſition.</note> words he doth more particularly exaggerate that ſinne of omiſsion, whereof he accuſeth them verſe 1. namely that there was no knowledge of God in the land; by ſhewing that not onely the people, but alſo the prieſts, who ſhould inſtruct them, were vtterly deſtitute of this knowledge: and withall ſpecifieth Gods reall controuerſie, and particular puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he was purpoſed to inflict vpon them. In hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling whereof, we will firſt conſider of their ſinne, and then of their puniſhment. Their ſinne and puniſhment are joyntly expreſſed in theſe words: <hi>My people are deſtroyed for want of knowledge.</hi> Their ſinne was want of knowledge or ignorance of God and his true Religion: the which ſinne did lye hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie both vpon the Prieſts and people: vpon the Prieſts, not onely in that they were culpable of the ſame ignorance, of which he ſpeaketh afterwards, but alſo as they were cauſes of the peoples ignorance, and conſequently acceſſary to their deſtruction. For whereas they were bound by Gods law and ordinance, to inſtruct the people in the knowlegde of God and his true religion, for which they had great honour and large maintenance allowed them; they ſeazing vpon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and wages, vtterly neglected the duty, either through their owne ignorance, becauſe they could not, or through their idleneſſe or maliciouſneſſe, whereby they would not
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:10737:235"/> informe them in the knowledge of Gods truth, but ſuffered them to run headlong to their deſtruction.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe this ſinne of Ignorance did lye heauy vpon the people, for howſoeuer the Prieſts vtterly neglected their duety in teaching and inſtructing them, yet the people were not hereby excuſed: Firſt, becauſe they willingly ſuffered themſelues to bee hud-winckt by their Prieſts, and were contented to be nuzled in ignorance by theſe blinde guides, chuſing rather to goe on ſecurely in their ſinnes without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition or reproofe, then to be troubled by any meanes in their euil courſes. Secondly, becauſe though the Prieſts neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected their duetie, yet they had Gods Prophets ſent vnto them, to informe them in the knowledge of gods truth, whom they deſpiſed and refuſed to heare as hath beene ſhewed. Thirdly, in that they had the word and Law of God writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, deliuered vnto them, out of which through painfull read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and meditation they might haue attained vnto ſome knowledge. So that their caſe was vnlike the caſe of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, who had onely the light of nature, and ſo remained in ignorance becauſe they wanted the meanes of ſauing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: whereas they had the law and oracles of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto them, the which were faithfully expounded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by Gods Prophets, but they neglected the reading of the Law, and contemned the admonitions and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Prophets, and ſo were ignorant becauſe they would be ignorant, and loued the darkneſſe of errour better then the light of Gods truth. And this is Emphatically im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, whereas the Lord doth ſay (not the people but) <hi>my people:</hi> that is, this my people, with whom I haue made my Couenant, and vnto whom I haue giuen my Law, and ſent my Prophets to inſtruct them in my truth, euen they are deſtroyed for want of knowledge.</p>
               <p>The puniſhment inflicted both vpon Prieſts and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is deſtruction: whereby we are to vnderſtand not onely that temporarie deſtruction of their body, ſtate, and country by their enimies, but alſo their ſpirituall and euerlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction both of body and ſoule, for as it is eternall life to <note place="margin">Iohn. 17. 3.</note>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:10737:235"/> know God, his ſonne, and true Religion, ſo it bringeth eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death to be ignorant of them.</p>
               <p>And thus their ſinne and puniſhment hath beene joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed: now more particularly he expreſſeth both the ſinne and puniſhment of the Prieſts. The ſins of the Prieſts are foure; vnto euery one of which he annexeth a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable puniſhment: the two firſt are expreſſed in this Verſe. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt refuſed knowledge I will alſo refuſe thee, &amp;c.</hi> In which words he turneth his ſpeach, and maketh an Apoſtrophe to the Prieſts, accuſing them of a two-fold ſinne, and denouncing againſt them a two-fold puniſhment. Their firſt ſinne was that they had refuſed or contemned knowledge, the which as it was a great ſinne in the people, ſo moſt grieuous in the Prieſts; ſeeing in regard of their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <note place="margin">Ignorance a great ſinne in the Prieſts.</note> calling and function they were bound by the Law of God, not onely to haue an extraordinary meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge themſelues, but alſo to inſtruct others.

               </p>
               <p>The knowledge therefore which was required in the Prieſts, and which in this place they refuſed, was ſuch a knowledge, as was proper to their calling and function; that is, not onely a ſpeculatiue knowledge in the braine, but a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall knowledge, whereby they communicated that they knew to the people, not alone in the vnderſtanding, but in the lips, that is, in ſpeach, publiſhing and preaching Gods truth, that the people may ſeeke it from their mouth: not an idle knowledge, whereby they know to know, and make no vſe of it; but an operatiue knowledge whereby they teach &amp; informe Gods people in his true religion.</p>
               <p>The ſin therefore which is here condemned in the prieſts is, that they vſurped the office of the Prieſthood, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged the honour, and ſeazed vpon the profits due vnto it,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:10737:236"/> but neglected their duety; for thinking it ſufficient, to weare the habite, and offer the Sacrifices, and adminiſter the other Ceremonies, they refuſed the chiefe duety which God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of them; that is, to teach the people, for they vtterly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and diſpiſed the knowledge of God and his trueth themſelues, or at leaſt ſuch a knowledge as their calling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; for though they had ſome knowledge in the braine, yet they had none in the lips; though they had ſome in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, yet through idleneſſe, or careleſneſſe, or couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or ambition, they made no vſe of it, for the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the people, for they were deſtroyed for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>And this was their ſinne. The puniſhment which the Lord doth proportionate vnto it is, that becauſe they had refuſed knowledge, he would refuſe them, that they ſhould be no Prieſts vnto him: where we are to obſerue, that hee ſpeaketh vnto them as vnto one man in the ſingular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for the greater Emphaſis; ſhewing that ſeeing they had joyned together as one man in their ſinne, ſo they ſhould bee joyned as one in the puniſhment, and not one of them eſcape.</p>
               <p>The puniſhment it ſelfe is, that God would refuſe them, and not ſuffer them to be his Prieſts. They could be content to beare the title, and haue the honour, and receiue the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Gods Prieſts, and ſerue God with a meſſe of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and ſacrifices, becauſe theſe things required ſmall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and brought great profit, ſo they might neglect the maine duety of all, namely, the informing themſelues in the knowledge of God and his truth, and the teaching and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing of the people But the Lord telleth them, that by no meanes hee would ſuffer theſe to be ſeuered; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing they had refuſed the maine and eſſentiall duety of the Prieſthood, he would refuſe them for being any longer his Prieſts; if they would not take the paines, hee would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine them of the gaines; if they would not beare the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, hee would pull from them the honour and reward. So that no knowledge, no Prieſts to him.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:10737:236"/>
               <p> Where we are further to obſerue a ſingular Emphaſis in the words, for firſt the Verbe here vſed, which is tranſlated, <hi>I will refuſe thee,</hi> is in an vnvſuall forme, hauing <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> extrordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily added before the affixe: by which increaſe of the word, the Lord would intend the ſignification: namely, that hee would not after an vſuall manner refuſe them, but with great contempt and reproach. Secondly, whereas he ſaith, <hi>I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe thee, and thou ſhalt be no Prieſt to mee;</hi> he implyeth, that howſoeuer they were allowed as Prieſts by men, namely, by the Prince, ſtate &amp; people, yet wanting knowledge he would diſavow them; howſoeuer they ſuffered them to performe outward ſeruice in the Church, in the Ceremonies and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, yet they ſhould not execute the office of the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood vnto him; neyther would he reſpect any thing they did, ſeeing they were ignorant and neglected the maine duety of teaching the people. Though therfore they were the princes Prieſts, yet they ſhould be none of his; though they ſerued the peoples turne, and were fit Prieſts for their deuotions, yet he would make no account of their ſeruice, which was joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ignorance, and conſequently not performed in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and truth.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſinne is, that they had <hi>forgotten the Law of their God;</hi> theſe words ſome vnderſtand as ſpoken of the people; but howſoeuer theſe by conſequence may be judged culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this ſinne (for if the Prieſts who ſhould haue continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally put the people in minde of Gods Law and Couenant made with them, had themſelues forgotten it, then much more the ignorant people) yet as I take it, firſt and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally this ſinne is condemned in the Prieſts, becauſe both the wordes going before, and the wordes following are to be vnderſtood of them. The ſinne is forgetfulneſſe of Gods Law, which is a fruite of their former ſinne, namely, their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and contempt of it, for <hi>etiam ſenes quae curant memine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,</hi> thoſe things are retained in minde euen of thoſe who haue ſliperie memories, which they regard and care for. Whereas therefore he ſaith, that they did not ſo much as remember Gods Law, hereby hee intimateth that their
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:10737:237"/> neglect and contempt of it was moſt notorious.</p>
               <p>Now whereas he ſaith further, not ſimply that they had forgotten the law of God, but of thy God; this alſo hath his emphaſis and aggrauats their ſinne, in that euery people is principally to remember the lawes of their owne ſoueraigne, but God was their King, and they had bound themſelues by couenant that they would heare, remember &amp; obey his law, the which couenant they ſhamefully broke, for ſo farre were they from obeying Gods law that they would not ſo much as take any notice of it, or vouchſafe it a place in their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie.</p>
               <p>The puniſhment threatned is proportionable to the ſinne, namely that God likewiſe would forget their children; the which is ſpoken after the manner of men, that he might the better fit himſelfe to their capacitie: for if wee ſpeake properly, God cannot be ſaid to forget or remember, ſeeing all things paſt, preſent, and to come, are preſent before him in one perfect view: but hereby hee would ſignifie vnto them, that as they had ſo neglected his law, that they did not ſo much as remember it, ſo he would vtterly neglect them, and withdraw from them all ſignes of his loue and care, as if he had vtterly forgotten them and his couenant made with them. Now whereas he ſaith that hee would <hi>forget their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:</hi> the meaning is that he would deſtroy the Prieſthood: for ordinarily the children ſucceeded the parents in the Prieſts office; but now he telleth them that he would not onely ſtrip them of this honour, but their poſteritie alſo, and ſo make the prieſthood to ceaſe: for whereas he threatneth the children, he much more includeth the parents; for if the heate of Gods wrath extended to the children, for their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſinnes; much more ſhould it be inflamed againſt the fathers themſelues.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, whereas hee ſpeaking of the Prieſts ſinne, ſaith that they had forgotten his Law; and of his owne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, that hee would forget their children: hereby is implyed Gods mercifull juſtice and mans impietie, in that God doth not forget them, before they haue forgotten him;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:10737:237"/> and therefore if God at any time neglect and forget his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, it is manifeſt that it is becauſe they haue neglected and forgotten him firſt.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I ſhewed the meaning of the words: the doctrines which ariſe out of them are diuers. The firſt thing <note place="margin">That ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is a great ſinne in the people.</note> to be obſerued is, that if a people liue in ignorance of God and his religion, for want of teaching and inſtruction, the Lord condemneth it as a great ſinne, both in the miniſters and people In the miniſters, in that they neglect their dutie, and eyther through their inſufficiencie or idleneſſe, ſuffer them to goe on in the wayes of darkneſſe to their perdition, whereby they become acceſſarie, yea principall cauſes of their deſtruction, of which I ſhall ſpeake afterwards. And in the people, in that they are content to liue in their ignorance, and voluntarily ſubmit themſelues to be led by ſuch blinde guids, as cannot informe them in the wayes of the Lord. For they ſhould haue care of their owne ſoules, though others neglect it: they ſhould count this one thing neceſſarie, to be inſtructed in the knowledge of gods truth, and preferre it before their worldly affaires; they ſhould wanting this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pearle of gods word, rather ſell all they haue to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it, then content themſelues to be without it; they ſhould themſelues read, ſtudie, and meditate in the ſcriptures, which are ſufficient to make them wiſe to ſaluation, eſpecially when the ordinarie meanes faile.</p>
               <p>But this ſin is much more haynous in the people, if they continue in ignorance when as the Lord giueth them liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the meanes of knowledge; if they wilfully ſhut their eyes when the light of Gods word clearly ſhineth vnto them; if they continue blinde becauſe they will not ſee; if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to heare the word preached, or neglect and deſpiſe it when they heare it, as not worth the knowing or remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring; if they chuſe rather to be vnder blind guides, becauſe they would not be troubled with hearing and learning, or with admonitions and reprehenſions (whereas they rather deſire to liue quietly and ſecurely in their ſinnes) then vnder faithfull and painefull Miniſters, who would diſturbe their
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:10737:238"/> eaſe and awake their conſciences out of the ſleepe of ſinne, for ſuch liuing in ignorance are without excuſe, and for want of knowledge ſhall moſt certainely be deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be obſerued is, that where the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">The people ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed which want know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> are deſtitute of knowledge for want of inſtruction, there the people &amp; miniſters ſhalbe deſtroyed. The people firſt, becauſe they content themſelues with ſuch blind guids and willingly remaine in their ignorance: ſecondly, becauſe want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowledge they depriue themſelues of all meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may be ſaued, for thoſe whom God hath elected to ſaluation as to the end, he hath alſo ordained that they ſhould vſe the meanes, whereby they may attaine to ſaluation; that is, that they ſhould be effectually called, juſtified, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; but none can attaine to any of theſe meanes without the knowledge of God and his religion: for whomſoeuer God effectually calleth, thoſe with his word and holy ſpirit hee illuminateth with the knowledge of his will, their owne miſerie, the worke of redemption wrought by Chriſt, and with other principles and fundamentall poynts of Religion; without then this knowledge there is no effectuall calling. So likewiſe no juſtification, for whoſoeuer are juſtifyed they are alſo endued with a liuely faith, whereby they apply vnto themſelues the merits and ſuffrings of Chriſt; but without knowledge there is no faith, for wee cannot beleeue and be certainely perſwaded of that whereof wee are ignorant, and conſequently no juſtifycation. In a word without knowledge there is no ſanctifycation; for knowledge is the foundation of all vertue and obedience, without which wee can neyther chuſe the good nor refuſe the euill. Now without theſe meanes there is no ſaluation, neyther is there any ſaued, but thoſe who are effectually called, juſtified and ſanctified; and therefore it neceſſarily followeth, that they who want know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, are deſtroyed. This might be proued more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whether we reſpect the temporary deſtruction of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſtate, or the eternall deſtruction of the ſoule, but that I haue already handled this point before, intreating of the firſt verſe of this Chapter.</p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:10737:238"/>
               <p> But if this want of knowledge in the people, proceed from the inſufficiencie or idleneſſe of their miniſters, then doth it bring deſtruction to them alſo, as being the cauſes of their ruine. This the Lord threatneth. Ezech. 3. 18. and 33. 8. <note place="margin">Ezech. 3. 18. &amp; 33. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>When I ſhall ſay to the wicked, O wicked man thou ſhalt dye the the death, if thou doſt not ſpeake and admoniſh the wicked man of his way, that wicked man ſhall dye for his iniquitie, but his bloud will I require at thy hand.</hi> To which <hi>Paul</hi> ſeemeth to allude Act. 20. 26. Where approuing his paines in his miniſtery, <note place="margin">Act. 20. 26.</note> he ſaith, he was pure from the bloud of all men: From which place <hi>Gregorie</hi> thus concludeth: <hi>tot occidimus, quot ad mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem ire tepidi &amp; tacentes videmus.</hi> Wee murther (ſaith hee) ſo many as we ſee going the way to deſtruction, and careleſly hold our peace.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this doctrine ſerueth to teach vs in what a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable eſtate ſuch a people are, who content themſelues to liue in ignorance, whether they want the meanes of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or hauing them doe neglect and contemne them, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they liue in their ſinnes, without any hope to attaine vnto ſaluation, or to eſcape deſtruction. Thoſe that want the meanes cannot be excuſed, if they do not labour after them, ſeeing Chriſt hath taught vs, that this one thing is moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, <note place="margin">Iohn. 6. 27.</note> and more to be deſired then our bodily food: in the obtaining whereof whoſoeuer imploy themſelues, they are preferred before ſuch as giue worldly entertainement to Chriſt himſelfe, as appeareth, Luk. 10. 39 40. 41. 42. That <note place="margin">Luk. 10. 39. 40</note> it is of greater value then all worldly wealth, and therefore if we want it, we are rather to ſell all wee haue, to purchaſe this precious pearle, then to bee without it. Whereas theſe <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 45.</note> men eſteeme this vnvaluable jewell, of all other things leaſt neceſſary, and will not part with the leaſt worldly benefit for the obtaining of it. But much more doe thoſe offend, and accordingly ſhall more fearefully be puniſhed, who hauing the meanes of knowledge, the preaching of the Goſpell, doe neglect and contemne it, who walke in the darke wayes of ignorance, becauſe they wilfully ſhut their eyes when the brightlight of the Goſpell ſhineth vnto them, and continue
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:10737:239"/> deſtitute of knowledge, becauſe they ſtop their eares, not vouchſafing to heare inſtruction: and yet in the meane time theſe men haue a ſtrong conceipt, that they ſhall attaine vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſaluation: as though the way to heauen were ſo direct and ſtraight, that they could eaſily finde it, though they goe blinde-fold, and not ſo much as deſire a guide: quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the whole courſe of Scripture, wherein the Lord hath taught vs, that his will is, that thoſe who ſhall be ſaued, ſhall alſo come to the knowledge of his truth. 1 Tim. 2. 4. <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 4.</note> That it is the onely meanes to attaine vnto life eternall, <hi>to know God and his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Iohn. 17. 3. That thoſe <note place="margin">Ioh. 17. 5.</note> whoſe <hi>feete are to trauaile in the way of peace,</hi> muſt firſt bee illightened <hi>with the knowledge of Saluation.</hi> Luke. 1. 77. 78. <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 77. 78.</note> 79. And contrariwiſe that they who ſit <hi>in darkneſſe,</hi> they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſit in the <hi>ſhadow of death,</hi> as it is in the ſame place, that they are <hi>ſtrangers from the life of God.</hi> Eph. 4. 18. That the <hi>Lord</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>will render vengeance to thoſe that doe not know him.</hi> 2 Theſ. <note place="margin">2 Theſ. 1. 8.</note> 1. 8. And that they ſhall be deſtroyed, as it is in this place.</p>
               <p>The ſecond vſe concerneth the miniſters, ſeruing for an <note place="margin">The Miniſters muſt teach the people.</note> effectuall argument to perſwade them, that they performe their duety, in teaching and inſtructing the people, leaſt wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting inſtruction, they alſo want knowledge, and ſo be made ſubject to vtter deſtruction. Whereby it will come to paſſe, that thoſe Miniſters, who through their negligence are the cauſes hereof, ſhall being guilty of their ſinnes, be alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed with them. Now if the waight of a mans owne ſin be an intollerable burthen, what vvill become of thoſe, who ſhall beare the waight not onely of their owne ſinne, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of their vvhole congregation, vnto vvhich through their idleneſſe or inſufficiency they haue beene acceſſarie?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it ſerueth for the reproofe of the Papiſts, vvho <note place="margin">The papiſts la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to keepe the people in blindneſſe.</note> by all meanes poſsible, labour to keepe the people in blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ignorance, by taking away from them the light of Gods vvord both read and preached, that ſo keeping them blind-fold, they may abuſe them at pleaſure, and like carrion Crowes hauing picked out their eyes, may make a pray of them. But let all know, that vvhat faire ſhewes ſoeuer they
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:10737:239"/> make, and how curiouſly ſoeuer they paint ouer this rotten poſt, with the colours of their deuotion, whereby they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derprop the ruinous building of their high raiſed Hirarchie; yet in very truth by depriuing the people of knowledge, they depriue them alſo of ſaluation, and make them ſubject to vtter deſtruction, and ſo conſequently they make themſelues guilty both of their ſinne and ruine; of both which they haue beene the principall cauſes.</p>
               <p>The third thing to be obſerued is, that as the want of knowledge is a ſin in all men, ſo eſpecially in the Miniſter, <note place="margin">That ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce is a grieuous ſinne in the Miniſters.</note> whether we vnderſtand it of that ſufficiencie of knowledge which he ought to haue in himſelfe, whereby he is inabled to teach the people, or the fruitfull vſe of this knowledge for the inſtruction of the people; for of him is required, not onely the facultie but alſo the function; not onely that hee hath knowledge in the braine, but alſo in his lips; not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he hath light in himſelfe, but alſo that he giueth light to others; not onely that he know the way to Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but alſo that he informe thoſe committed to his charge in this way. Here therefore is firſt condemned the ignorance and inſufficiencie of the Miniſter; whereby hee is vtterly diſabled for the performing of his dutie in teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people, the which is a haynous ſin in Gods ſight, as may appeare by theſe reaſons: firſt, in that they thruſt themſelues into this great worke of the Miniſtery being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vnfurniſhed of thoſe gifts which ſhould fit them for this function: for aboue all other things it is required in a Miniſter that he be fit to teach. 1. Tim. 3. 2. and Tim. 2. 2 but theſe cannot teach others, being themſelues ignorant. <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3. 2. 2. Tim. 2. 2. Mat. 5. 14.</note> Gods true miniſters are the <hi>Light of the world.</hi> Math. 5. 14. appointed by God to illuminate thoſe <hi>who ſit in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and in the ſhadow of death;</hi> Luk. 1. 77. 78. but theſe men wanting the light of knowledge in themſelues, cannot giue <note place="margin">Luk. 1. 77. 78</note> light vnto others, and ſo they ſit both together in the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of death: if then they who ſhould be the light are <hi>darkneſſe how great is that darknes</hi> Mat. 6. 23. The miniſter in the Church is as the eye in the body, and the knowledge <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 23.</note>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:10737:240"/> of the Miniſter, as the ſight in the eye, ſuch Miniſters then as want knowlege, they are ſtarke blinde, as the Lord himſelfe plainely concludeth. Eſay. 56. 10. <hi>Their watchmen are blinde,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſay. 56. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>they haue no knowledge:</hi> and conſequently when theſe are in ſtead of guides, then <hi>the blinde doe lead the blinde and ſo they fall both into the pit,</hi> as our Sauiour ſpeaketh. Mat. 15. 14. <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 14.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The Miniſters are the mouth of God vnto the people, and the mouth of the people vnto God: but theſe men are dumbe and cannot ſpeake, <hi>they are the meſſengers of the Lord of hoaſts,</hi> Mal. 2. 7. Hag. 1. 13. by whoſe ambaſſage there is peace concluded, and reconciliation made betweene God <note place="margin">Mal. 2. 7. Hag. 1. 13.</note> and man: 2 Cor. 5. 18. 20. but theſe men are altogether vnfit for theſe offices, ſeeing they cannot doe their meſſage, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 18. 20</note> nor deliuer their ambaſſage. They are the nurſes of Gods children, who nouriſh them with the <hi>milke of the word, that they may grow vp there by:</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 2. but theſe men hauing drye breaſts, doe ſtarue the Lords people, and ſo are no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 2.</note> then murtherers in his ſight. They are Gods ſhepheards to feede his Lambes: Iohn. 21. 15. but theſe ignorant ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards <hi>non paſcunt, ſed depaſcunt gregem,</hi> they feede not the <note place="margin">Iohn. 21. 15.</note> flock, but feede vpon it, they eate the milke, and cloth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with the wool, but lead them not into the greene pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of Gods truth, but let them periſh for want of food; and therefore a fearefull woe lyeth vpon them, as appeareth. Ezech. 34. 2. 3. Gods faithfull Miniſters are his Stewards, who haue in their ſtore-houſe new and old, and doe giue to <note place="margin">Ezech. 34. 2. 3.</note> euery one of the familie their portion in due ſeaſon: Luke. 12. 42. but theſe men haue no ſtore of prouiſion, neyther <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 42.</note> haue they any skill to diuide this ſpirituall food of the word aright, and ſo famiſh the familie, and diſgrace their maiſter. <note place="margin">Eſay. 22. 22.</note> They are the guides and Captaines of the Lord of hoaſts, to goe before the people towards the heauenly Canaan, and teach them ſo to handle their weapons, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell and ouercome their enimies, who aſſault them in the way, and labour to hinder them from going forward in this ſpiritual march, but theſe men do not know the way the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:10737:240"/> and therfore cannot direct others. They are not vſed to the ſpirituall armour, nor know how to handle the ſword of the ſpirit, and therefore are vtterly vnfit to traine vp others, or to make them fit for this ſpirituall war-fare. They are the ſalt of the earth, and knowledge is the ſauoury ſaltneſſe of this ſalt: but theſe men wanting knowledge, are vnſauourie ſalt, which is good for nothing, no not for the dunghill, but deſerueth to be caſt out and trodden vnder foote. Luk. 14. <note place="margin">Luk. 14. 34. 35</note> 34. 35. that is, to bee condemned and deſpiſed of all men, the which puniſhment the Lord threatneth. Mal. 2. 9. <note place="margin">Mal. 2. 9.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, ſuch ignorant Miniſters doe grieuouſly ſinne, in <note place="margin">Ignorant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters vſurpe an office vnto which they are not called.</note> that they preſumptuouſly take vpon them, this great office, vnto which they are not called of God; for whomſoeuer the Lord calleth to any function, thoſe he inableth in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to diſcharge the duety which he requireth of them, for his calling is effectual &amp; miniſtreth efficacie to thoſe whom he calleth, to effect thoſe dueties whereunto he calleth them. As ſoone as he called <hi>Aholiab</hi> and <hi>Bezalcell,</hi> to builde his <note place="margin">Exo. 35. 30. 31.</note> Tabernacle, hee endued them with wiſedome and skill fit for the worke; and how much more will hee furniſh with knowledge, and ſpirituall wiſdome, thoſe whom he chuſeth to builde vp his Church? There is no wiſe man, will chuſe him for his Carpenter, who is ignorant in building; or for his Husbandman, who hath no skill in husbandry; or for his Shepheard, who hath no diſcretion to feede his Sheepe: and ſhall we thinke God leſſe wiſe or prouident then mortall man? No aſſuredly, thoſe whom he appoynteth to be lights he firſt illumina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>, that ſo they may giue light vnto others: thoſe whom hee maketh eyes in the ſpirituall body of the Church, he endueth with the ſight of knowledge, whereby they may be enabled to guide and direct the members of the body: the mouthes of his making for his owne vſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, are not dumbe nor tongue-tyed: thoſe meſſengers and ambaſſadours which are of his ſending, are wiſe and willing to deliuer his meſſage; for he that condemneth this in others, <note place="margin">Prou. 26. 6.</note> will not approue it in his owne practiſe: thoſe vvhom he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth nurſes to his children, haue the milk of knowledge
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:10737:241"/> in their breaſts, neyther would the Lord commit his little infants, to ſuch as would ſtarue them for want of milke: he neuer made them his ſhepheards, who haue no foode for his ſheep; nor them his ſtewards who haue no prouiſion in ſtore, nor wiſdome to giue fit nouriſhment to his family: he neuer made blinde men to be his guides; nor freſh-water ſouldiers to be his Captaines: and the ſalt of his making is ſauoury in it ſelfe, and fit to ſeaſon that which is vnſauoury. It follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth therefore, that ſeeing they are not called of God; that they runne before they are ſent, like thoſe falſe Prophets Ier. 14. 14. 15. and are groſe intruders into thoſe offices in <note place="margin">Ier. 14. 14. 15.</note> which they haue no skill; for which intruſion, they ſhall one day make a feareful account. For if it be intollerable for any to profeſſe himſelfe an ambaſſadour, when as hee was neuer ſent by his Prince, nor hath receyued any meſſage from him: how much more horrible is it for a ſinfull man, by intruſion to vſurpe the place and dignitie of Gods Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, whom the Lord neuer called to this office and function?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this ſinne of ignorance is haynous in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, <note place="margin">Ignorant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters deſtroy both their owne &amp; other mens ſoules.</note> in that it deſtroyeth not onely his owne ſoule, but bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth deſtruction to the people, becauſe hereby they are depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the preaching of the word, the ordinary meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they ſhould be ſaued. So the wiſe man teacheth vs. Prou. 29. 18. <hi>Where there is no viſion there the people decay.</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <note place="margin">Prou. 29. 18.</note> is apparant, for whomſoeuer the Lord in his eternal coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, hath purpoſed to preſerue from deſtruction, and to elect vnto ſaluation, he hath ordained in the ſame eternall counſell that thoſe ſhall vſe the ſubordinate meanes, wherby they may be ſaued: as firſt, that being elected they ſhould be alſo ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called; being called they ſhould be juſtified; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing juſtified they ſhould bee ſanctified; and ſo being ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied they ſhould alſo be gloryfied, as appeareth. Rom. 8. 30 <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 30.</note> But all theſe the Lord ordinarily effecteth by the Miniſtery of the Word, as may appeare in the particulars. For firſt, the ordinary meanes of our effectuall calling, is the preaching of the Goſpell, as appeareth Ephe. 4. 11. 12. <hi>He therefore gaue</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 11. 12</note>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:10737:241"/> 
                  <hi>ſome to bee Apoſtles, and ſome Euangeliſtes, and ſome Paſtort and Teachers: for the gathering together of the Saints, for the worke of the miniſterie, &amp; for the edification of the body of Chriſt.</hi> So hee ſayth, <hi>that by the Goſpell we are called to that ſaluation, vnto which we were elected, and to obtaine the glorie of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 13. 14. And this is ſignified in the <note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2. 13. 14.</note> Parable, where all that come to the wedding ſupper are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thereunto by the kings ſeruants. Math. 22. 2. 3. <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 2. 3.</note>

               <p>So we are juſtified by faith, whereby we lay hould vpon Chriſt, who is our juſtification: but this faith is ordinarily begot in vs by the miniſtrie of the word preached. Rom. 10. <note place="margin">Rom. 10. 14. 15. 17.</note> 14. 15. 17. And hence it is that this word is called <hi>the word of Faith.</hi> Verſe 8. And the diſpenſers thereof <hi>the miniſters</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">8.</note> 
                  <hi>by whom wee beleeue.</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 5. Therefore without the <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 5.</note> preaching of the word ordinarily there is no Faith, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith no Iuſtification.</p>
               <p>The third meanes to ſaluation is our ſanctification, which is a neceſſarie effect of our juſtification, for <hi>they that are in Chriſt, are new creatures.</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17. But we are ſanctified <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 17.</note> and regenerate, <hi>not of mortall ſeed but of immortall, by the word of God.</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 23. And hence it is that the Miniſters of the <note place="margin">1. Peter. 1. 23.</note> Goſpell, who are the diſpenſers of this immortall ſeede, are called the ſpirituall fathers of thoſe whom they beget vnto God. 1 Cor. 4. 15. Therefore take away the Miniſterie <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 15.</note> of the word, and take away regeneration; without which we cannot enter into the kingdome of heauen. Ioh. 3. 3. <note place="margin">Iohn. 3. 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly as the meanes of Saluation, ſo ſaluation it ſelfe is aſcribed to the Miniſterie of the word preached; for <hi>Paul</hi> exhorting <hi>Timothie</hi> to faithfull diligence in his Miniſterie, doth vſe this as an effectuall reaſon, becauſe hereby <hi>Hee ſhould ſaue not onely himſelfe but alſo thoſe that heard him.</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 16. <note place="margin">1.

               </p>
               <p>Seeing therefore the preaching of the word is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie meanes of ſaluation, hence it followeth that the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of this preaching is the ordinarie meanes which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth deſtruction; and conſequently ſuch Miniſters as take vppon them the charge of ſoules, and doe not feede them
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:10737:242"/> with this bread of life, are principall cauſes whereby thoſe People are deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this doctrine ſerueth for the admonition of <note place="margin">Sufficiencie of gifts neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily required in Miniſters.</note> diuers ſorts of men, and for their reproofe if they neglect this admonition. Firſt all intending the Miniſterie, or hauing taken the charge vpon them, are to be admoniſhed that they ſeriouſly examine themſelues, whether they are furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with knowledge and other gifts neceſſarily required to this calling; otherwiſe they are not to enter into it, if alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy they haue not vndertaken it, or not to continue in this calling if they be already entered: for what will it profite them to get thereby worldly mainteynance, or an eaſie and idle life, if they through their ignorance and inſufficiencie, neglecting their dutie, deſtroy not onely their owne ſoules, but alſo the precious ſoules of the people committed to their charge.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Parents are here admoniſhed, that they doe not <note place="margin">Parents muſt not offer the lame &amp; hault to God.</note> offer the lame, hault, and ſicke vnto God, that is, that they do not preferre to the ſeruice of the ſanctuarie, ſuch of their children, as in reſpect of their inſufficiencie of gifts are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for any other vocation, and therefore much more vnfit for this, vnto which the beſt gifts are ſcarce ſufficient; for what are ſuch children behoulding to their Parents for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiding them maintenance by placing them in this calling, ſeeing by prouiding for their bodies for a time, they deſtroy both body and ſoule for euer, and make them alſo the cauſes of the deſtruction of others? in which reſpect they ſhould deale better with them if they made them prentiſes to the baſeſt trades, wherein they might liue in the feare of God with a good conſcience.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it admoniſheth Patrons and Church gouernours, that the one preſent not, the other admit not into paſtorall <note place="margin">No ignorant men ought to be preferred to the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieſtrie.</note> charges, ſuch as through their ignorance muſt of neceſsitie ſtarue their flocke; for if they eyther through fooliſh pittie, friendſhip, or corruption, commit the ſoules of men to bee nouriſhed by ſuch nurſes, as in their owne knowledge they they are aſſured haue dry breaſts, and cannot giue vnto them
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:10737:242"/> the ſincere milke of the Word, not onely theſe who are the next and immediate cauſes of their deſtruction ſhall periſh with them, but alſo they who being placed as Stewards in Gods familie, haue ſhewed ſo little care in prouiding food for his children and ſeruants.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it ſerueth to admoniſh the people, that they doe <note place="margin">The people muſt not ſeate themſelues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der blind guides.</note> not reſt contented to be ſtill lead by ſuch blinde guides, nor to be vnder the charge of ſuch ignorant and vnskilfull ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, as haue no knowledge to feede them; for what will it profit them, if by liuing in ſuch places they may haue plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for their bodies, if in the meane while their ſoules, are ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued? what benefit will they haue by any worldly conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie in their place of abode; the neighbour-hood of their friends; the goodneſſe of the ayre; the pleaſantneſſe of the ſeate; the fitneſſe of liuing there for to gaine in their trade or calling: yea, what if in euery reſpect it be like the ſeate of Sodome, which was pleaſant and fruitfull as the Garden of <note place="margin">Gen. 13. 10.</note> God; if for want of inſtruction, it be a Sodome alſo in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſinne, which with the inhabitants thereof muſt one day be deſtroyed? There is no man ſo fooliſh that would be allured eyther by pleaſure or profit, to dwell in a place where there is no bread to preſerue the life of his body, but much more fooliſh are they who are incited by theſe baites to liue in ſuch a place where there is no foode for the ſoule. No man would dwell in a towne which is aſſaulted by eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and hath no watch-man to giue warning of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch, though the place were both pleaſant &amp; profitable, for what would it aduantage him to haue wealth &amp; all delights, if he be in a continuall feare that he ſhall be deſtroyed? but we in this world haue not onely our ſpirituall enimies to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault vs, but alſo whole armies of Gods judgements ready to invade vs, if we liue in ſinne and ignorance; if therefore we want a watch man to giue vs warning of the approach of theſe enimies and judgements, that by putting on the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall armour, we may be inabled to repell the one, and by returning vnto God our king, whom by our ſinnes we haue offended, we may be preſerued from the other, what will
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:10737:243"/> the profits and pleaſures of this life benefit vs, ſeeing we are daylie in daunger to be deſtroyed? For as our Sauiour ſaith. Mar. 8. 36. <hi>What will it profit a man if he ſhall win the whole</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 8. 36.</note> 
                  <hi>world, if he ſhall looſe his owne ſoule.</hi> Rather therefore let vs follow <hi>Maryes</hi> example, that is, howſoeuer we think world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things conuenient, yet <hi>let vs iudge this one thing neceſſarie.</hi> Luke. 10. 42. And the practiſe of the wiſe Merchant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued <note place="margin">Luk. 10. 42.</note> by our Sauiour Chriſt, that is, let vs rather ſell all vvee haue to purchaſe this precious pearle of Gods Word, then content our ſelues to liue without it. Mat. 13. 45. 46. <note place="margin">Mat. 13. 45. 46</note>
               </p>
               <p>And thus haue I ſhewed, that it is a great ſinne in the <note place="margin">The greatnes of their ſinne who hauing knowledge do not teach the people.</note> Miniſter to vndertake this calling, when through ignorance he is vnable to teach the people: the like may be ſayde of thoſe, who hauing knowledge and learning doe not inſtruct the people; eyther through idlenes, careleſnes, couetouſnes, ambition or want of a good conſcience. For howſoeuer they haue neuer ſo great a meaſure of knowledge, yet if we ſpeake of ſuch knowledge, as is required to the office and function of a Miniſter, they haue only ſo much as they make vſe of in <note place="margin">Idle Miniſters as bad as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note> their Miniſterie; and therefore if they vſe little or none at all, they haue little or none of that knowledge which is required of them. The Lord requireth not only that the Prieſts head, but alſo his lips ſhould preſerue knowledge, and that the people from his mouth ſhould ſeeke inſtruction. Mal. 2. 7. <note place="margin">Mal. 2. 7.</note> Not onely that they haue the profound knowledge of the learned, but that they <hi>haue the tongue of the learned, to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>

                  <hi>a word in time to him that is weary,</hi> as it is Eſay. 50. 4. Not onely that they haue the tallent; but alſo that they vſe the tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. Not onely that they haue ſtore of prouiſion, but alſo that they doe diſtribute it to the relieuing of Gods people: which duety if they neglect, they are no better then igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Miniſters; nay they are worſe, if wee reſpect their owne mindes, and full as bad if wee reſpect the peoples benefit. They are worſe in themſelues, for they are more to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, who can inſtruct them and will not, then they that would and cannot, for they are like vnto rich but hard-harted cornemorants, who hauing their barnes and garners full of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:10737:243"/> corne, let the people famiſh for want of food, or at leaſt like Monopoliſts, hauing ingroſed theſe ſpirituall commodities, they will not vtter them but at exceſsiue rates; eyther when they are largely feed, or hope thereby to attaine vnto great credit or preferment. Where as the other let the people pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for want of prouiſion, and furniſh not the market be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their ware-houſes are empty. The ignorant Miniſters are in themſelues dark and cannot giue light; the idle learned Miniſters haue light indeede, but whereas they ſhould ſet it in the Candleſtick of the Church, they hide it in their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, as vnder a buſhell, and will not lighten others: they are like blinde eyes, which cannot guide the people in the pathes of Gods truth; theſe eyes which wilfully winck and will not giue direction; and who ſo blinde as they who will not ſee? they are dumbe and cannot ſpeake; theſe ſullenly ſilent and will not ſpeake; they cannot deliuer Gods am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſage becauſe they want wit; theſe will not deliuer it, and will not becauſe they will not: they ſtarue their children which they haue taken vpon them to nurſe, becauſe they haue drye breaſts; theſe haue milke inough, but herein more cruell then the ſauage Dragons, they will not take paines to draw them out. Lamen. 4. 3. They are ignorant ſhepheards, <note place="margin">Lamen. 4. 3.</note> and cannot feede Chriſts flocke; theſe are idle ſhepheards, who will not indure the labour; or couetous ſhepheards, who taking vpon them the charge of diuers flocks in diuers places, whileſt they are with the one, of neceſsitie ſuffer the other to ſtarue, or to be deuoured of the wolfe; or at the beſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to the keeping of hirelings, in whom they cannot expect that care and conſcience which they want them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: ſeeing they are the principall, theſe but deputies: they bound to painfulneſſe with the ſtrong cable of their charge; theſe with the weake thread of ſome ſmall ſtipend. Or if gaine be the inducement to both, to take the care and pains, then it is not likely that the hireling will be moued to take this care and paines for ten or twenty pounds, ſeeing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues haue a hundred or two hundred pounds, and yet neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it. Howſoeuer it is, it is ſure, that theſe ingroſſers of
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:10737:244"/> Benefices greatly offend whatſoeuer their deputie be; for if inſufficient they then betray their flock by committing them to one who cannot feede them; if ſufficient, then they offend againſt him in takeing from him vnjuſtly the reward of his labours; for he that feedeth the flocke is to haue the wooll to cloth him, and the milke to feede him, and not he who taketh no paines about them.</p>
               <p>But as they are worſe in themſelues, then ignorant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſo as bad to the people; for it is all one to theſe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grie ſoules, whether their Miniſters ſuffer them to ſtarue, eyther becauſe they haue no prouiſion of foode, or becauſe hauing ſtore they will not communicate it for their reliefe; ſauing that it is a greater torment to the minde to ſtarue in the ſight of meate, or to periſh with thirſt in the ſight of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and a greater griefe to periſh helpleſſe in the preſence of thoſe vpon whom we relye for help, when hauing power they want will to relieue vs, then when hauing will they want power. It is all one to the people whether their guides are blinde or alwayes wincke; whether there bee no light at all, or it bee hid from them vnder a buſhell; whether they heare not Gods ambaſſage becauſe they cannot, or becauſe they will not deliuer it; whether their nurſes want milke themſelues or will not ſuffer them to ſucke it; whether they haue igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſhepheards that cannot feede them, or idle ſhepheards that will not feede them; whether they periſh for want of knowledge, becauſe their Miniſters cannot teach them, or becauſe hauing knowledge he will not teach them.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this doctrine ſerueth, firſt to perſwade all who <note place="margin">Arguments to perſwade Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diligence in their calling</note> haue vndertaken the great worke of the Miniſterie, and haue receiued from God ſome ſufficiencie of gifts for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge thereof, that they doe with all diligence, care, and conſcience, labour to performe the duties which belong to this high calling; which that they may the rather doe, I will propound ſome arguments to this purpoſe: of which ſome allure and perſwade, ſome force and conſtraine, to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and painefull preaching of the Word.

               <p>The fourth thing to be obſerued is that howſoeuer theſe ignorant prieſts were allowed by the king; and appointed by the gouernours of the Church of Iſraell; and entertained by the people; and ſo wore the habite and injoyed the liuings; and offred the Sacrifices; and vſed the other Ceremonies in the Church; yet the Lord plainely diſavoweth them, diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them of their titles, and depoſeth them from the office of Prieſt-hood; and flatly telleth them that he would refuſe them, ſo as they ſhould be no Prieſts to him, becauſe they had refuſed knowledge and neglected the maine duetie in teaching the people. From whence wee learne, that though ignorant &amp; idle Miniſters, haue neuer ſo manifold allowance
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:10737:247"/> and approbation from men, yet God rejecteth them as not being worth the hauing: for all who are called of God to this function, are furniſhed with ſufficiencie of gifts, where by they are able, and with willingnes of minde whereby they are readie to inſtruct his people: as for thoſe who are not thus fitted, it were a great diſparagement both to Gods wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome loue and prouidence, eyther to chuſe them, or to owne them. There is no wiſe Prince will chuſe a dumbe ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, or one who will not eyther for feare or idleneſſe do his meſſage; there is no houſholder would haue in his ſeruice a ſteward, who in reſpect of his follie cannot prouide for the familie; there is no man will chuſe ſuch an one for his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, who hath no skill in building nor knoweth how to handle a toole; there is no people ſo ſimple that will retain a ſhepheard, if they know that eyther he is ignorant how to vſe their ſheepe, or idle and careleſſe, and will not take paines eyther in feeding or defending them: and ſhall wee thinke the Lord leſſe wiſe or prouident then man, that hee ſhould ſend on his meſſage dumbe ambaſſadours; or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his familie to be gouerned by fooliſh or malicious ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; or chuſe for the building of his ſpirituall temple them that haue no knowledge, or will not labour; or ſet ouer his flocke ſuch ignorant or idle ſhepheards, who either want skill or will to feede his ſheepe, and to defend them from the Wolfe?</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof ſerueth firſt, to teach vs whom wee <note place="margin">Who are to be approued for faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</note> are to approue as the faithfull Miniſters of God; namely, not all who are allowed by men, ſeeing many of theſe are ignorant and many idle, the one wanting abilitie the other will to inſtruct the people, but onely thoſe who are furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſufficiencie of gifts whereby they can, and with wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe and alacritie whereby they will with painefull dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence informe the people in the wayes of God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſheweth and condemneth the grieuous ſinne of many amongſt vs, who runne and are not ſent, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly ruſh into the place of Gods ambaſſadours, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing neither calling nor approbation from him: yea &amp; that
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:10737:248"/> after in his word he hath plainely proteſted, that ſeeing they haue refuſed knowledge, he hath rejected and depoſed them from the Prieſt-hood. It is counted an hainous fault amongſt vs, for one who is lawfully ſuſpended and degraded, to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the function of the Miniſterie, but how much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable is their contempt againſt Gods ſoueraigne Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, who being for their ignorance depriued by him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected as being none of his Miniſters, dare yet audaciouſly take vpon them this office and function? Much better there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were it for ſuch, with thoſe falſe Prophets of whom <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charie</hi> ſpeaketh, to giue ouer the place of a Prophet, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Zach. 13. 4. 5.</note> aſhamed of their ignorance and inſufficiencie, and to lay aſide their habite, wherewith they haue deceiued and abuſed the people, and plainely to confeſſe I am no Prophet, I am an Husbandman, or an heard-man, or a tradeſ-man, then by retayning the place of Gods Miniſters, to inflame his wrath and pull downe his fearefull vengeance againſt them, Ezech. 34. 10. Ier. 27. 15. <note place="margin">Ezech. 34. 10. Ier. 27. 15. Knowledge &amp; not ſucceſsion a true note of a lawfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, it confuteth the doctrine of the Church of Rome, who approue their Prieſt-hood (not by their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or painefulneſſe in teaching the people, both which were vtterly neglected in former ages, till of latter yeares for pollicie ſake, they haue beene forced to take more paines, or rather through neceſsitie being otherwiſe vnable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their declinining hirarchie, but) by the continuall ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Biſhops, the which alſo they make a note infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible of the true Church. Notwithſtanding in this they goe not before the apoſtate Church of Iſraell, who had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall ſucceſsion of their Prieſts and Leuites, euen from <hi>Aarons</hi> time, and yet now they ceaſed to be the true Church of God, and are rejected from the Prieſt-hood. It is not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſucceſsion of the Miniſterie, but their knowledge and painefull diligence in teaching the people, which appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them to be the true Miniſters of God, and where theſe are, they are an infallible note of Gods true Church; but when the preaching of the Word is neglected, eyther through Ignorance or Idleneſſe, there is no Miniſterie
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:10737:248"/> approued of God, and conſequently no true Church.</p>
               <p>And ſo much concerning the ſinne of the Prieſts. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is forgetfulneſſe of God and his Law, in theſe words: <hi>And ſeeing thou haſt forgotten the law of thy God.</hi> Vnto which is annexed a grieuous puniſhment in theſe words: <hi>I will alſo forget thy children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their ſinne was forgetfulneſſe of Gods Law, for howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer <note place="margin">The expoſition</note> they were the Lords Prieſts, vnto whom Gods Oracles were committed, in which by Gods Commaundement they were to meditate continually, that ſo not onely knowing but alſo remembring them, they might be the better fitted both to obſerue them themſelues, and alſo to teach and inſtruct the people in the knowledge of Gods will, in his Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed, yet ſuch was their careleſneſſe, negligence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of it, that they neyther knew nor remembred it, and much leſſe obeyed it themſelues, or informed the people, that they might know and keepe it. From whence we may <note place="margin">Our inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe vnto forgetfulneſſe of God.</note> obſerue how inclinable we are to this vice of forgetfulneſſe, ſeeing neyther reſpect of our place and duety, nor any meanes that can be vſed will imprint Gods Law in the ſtony tables of our memories, vnleſſe it be engrauen with the finger of gods ſpirit, howſoeuer they are like waxe ready to receiue the print of any worldly impreſsion, &amp; like braſſe to keep it.</p>
               <p>The cauſes of this our forgetfulneſſe are, firſt, our naturall <note place="margin">The cauſes of our forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> corruption, and the vncleanneſſe of our hearts and mindes, being one of the curſed fruites of originall ſinne; whereof it is, that they are forges of wicked thoughts, fountaines from which nothing ſpring but carnall meditations, and like wide ſiues, which ſuffer all the flower of goodnes to paſſe through them, and retaine nothing but the groſe branne of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe and wickedneſſe. This appeareth. Gen. 6. 5. and. 8. 21. <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 5. &amp; 8. 21. Mat 15. 19.</note> Mat. 15. 19.</p>
               <p>The ſecond cauſe is our want of loue and delight in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly and ſpirituall things, and our too much loue of the world and worldly vanities; for if our treaſure were in the Arke of God, our hearts would be there alſo; if Gods Law were to vs, as it was vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> ſweeter then the hony &amp; the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:10737:249"/> hony combe; if with him we loued it better then all worldly riches, then would we alſo neuer forget it, but meditate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in day and night.</p>
               <p>The third cauſe of the forgetfulneſſe of Gods Law is, <note place="margin">Gods mercies make vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of him.</note> our pride of heart, through the vnthankfull abuſe of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie; for ſuch is our corruption, that whereas Gods bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits ſhould make vs mindfull of his Law, that in lue of thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, we might obey it; contrariwiſe the abundance of Gods mercies makes vs to forget not onely the Law, but euen God himſelfe, ſo the Lord complaineth. Hoſ. 13. 6. <note place="margin">Hoſ. 13. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>As in their paſtures ſo were they filled, they were filled, and their heart was exalted, therefore haue they forgotten me.</hi> Hence it is that the Lord giueth the Iſraelites ſo oft warning, that when they abounded in Gods bleſsings, they ſhould not ſuffer their hearts, to be lift vp, &amp; ſo to forget him the authour of all their good. Deut. 8. 11. 12. A man would thinke, that as tokens <note place="margin">Deut. 8. 11. 12.</note> ſent, ſerue to put vs in minde of an abſent friend, ſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable tokens of Gods loue, which as it were, from heauen he ſendeth vnto vs, ſhould ſerue as ſo many remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers, to put vs in minde of him who ſendeth them vnto vs, but (though againſt all reaſon) it falleth out otherwiſe, for the tokens of Gods loue, as riches, pleaſures, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, make vs forget the ſender; and therefore wiſe <hi>Hagur</hi> ſeeing this corruption in himſelfe, doth intreat the Lord to reſtraine his bountie, and not to beſtow too much vpon him, leaſt being full, he ſhould denie him, &amp; ſay who is the Lord. Prou. 30. 8. 9. <note place="margin">Pro. 30. 8. 9.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing therefore our corrupt nature is ſo inclinable to <note place="margin">The greatneſſe of this ſinne of forgetfulneſſe.</note> this vice of forgetfulneſſe, let vs labour not onely to ſee it, but alſo to ſubdue and mortifie it; which that we may the rather performe with the greater care and conſcience, let vs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the grieuouſneſſe of the ſinne, and the greatneſſe of the puniſhment which doth attend it. The grieuouſneſſe of the ſinne herein appeareth, in that it is not onely in it ſelfe haynous, but a cauſe alſo of innumerable other ſinnes. In it ſelfe it is a haynous ſinne as appeareth by the Lords often and earneſt forbidding of it. So Deut. 4. 23. <hi>Take heed vnto</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 4. 23. and 8. 11.</note>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:10737:249"/> 
                  <hi>your ſelues, leaſt you forget the couenant of the Lord your God.</hi> and 8. 11. <hi>Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God, not keeping his commaundements.</hi> And when the people notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe admonitions, did forget the Lord, he grieuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly complaineth of this neglect. So Deu. 32. 18. <hi>thou haſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 18. Eſay. 57. 11. Ier. 2. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>the mightie God that begat thee and formed thee.</hi> Eſa. 57. 11. &amp; Ier. 2. 32. <hi>Can a maide forget her ornament, or a bride her attire? yet my people hath forgotten me daies with out number.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, to forget God and his word is a kinde of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſme, ſeeing they haue not God nor his law in their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall parts, namely their heart, minde, and ſoule; for they who ſo haue them, doe alſo remember them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this forgetfulneſſe is ioyned with ſingular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Gods word, for they who regard it, doe alſo remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it; they that can ſay with <hi>Dauid,</hi> that <hi>they delight in his ſtatutes,</hi> may alſo adde that which hee addeth, <hi>that they will not forget his word.</hi> Pſal. 119. 16. <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, as this forgetfulneſſe, is in it ſelfe a ſinne, ſo it is the cauſe of almoſt all ſinne. Whereof it is that forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and the tranſgreſsion of the law are often joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as the cauſe and effect. Deut. 8. 11. <hi>Beware that thou</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 8. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>forget not the Lord thy God not keeping his commaundements.</hi> Ier. 3. 21. <hi>They haue peruerted their way and haue forgotten the Lord their God.</hi> Prou. 2. 17. <hi>Which forſaketh the guide of</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 3. 21.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 2. 17. Ezech. 22. 12</note>

Iud. 3. 7. <hi>The children of Iſraell did wickedly in the ſight of the Lord, and forgat the Lord their God.</hi> The reaſon is, becauſe <note place="margin">Iud. 3. 7.</note> they who doe not ſo much as remember the law of God can much leſſe obſerue it, and thoſe vvho neuer thinke, neyther on gods promiſes nor threatnings, are neither incouraged to that which is good, nor diſcouraged from that which is euill.</p>
               <p>But as this forgetfulneſſe is to be auoyded, in that it is a <note place="margin">The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſinne of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe.</note> grieuous ſinne, ſo alſo becauſe God inflicteth vpon it grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous puniſhments.

If when he neglecteth vs we are ſtraight depriued of all good, and expoſed vnto all euill, <note place="margin">Pſal. 104. 29.</note> then what is Gods forgetfulneſſe, but our deſtruction? ſo likewiſe in this particular where by Gods forgetting their children, is meant his neglect of them, the with-drawing of the ſignes of his loue, &amp; the diſinheriting of them of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Prieſt-hood: as if he would call backe his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſuffer them no more to beare the name of his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, turne them out of their ſtewardſhip, and make them more baſe then common ſeruants; make them of ſhepheards worſe then the meaneſt of the flocke; and of Captaines, common ſouldiers, which alſo with the reſt ſhould be caſheerd out of his Campe, the Church militant.</p>
               <p>Beſides this heauie judgement, there are diuers others threatned againſt this ſinne of forgetfulneſſe in the booke of God; and theſe both temporall and eternall. Of the firſt ſort is the puniſhment of barrenneſſe and dearth. Eſay. 17. <note place="margin">Eſay. 17. 10. 11</note> 10. 11. Deſolation and deſtruction of their cities. Hoſ. 8. <note place="margin">Hoſ. 8. 10.</note> 10. Bondage and ſubjection vnder tyrannicall enimies. 1. Sam. 12. 9. The Lord ſcattereth thoſe that forget him and <note place="margin">1 Sam. 12. 9.</note> his word, as ſtubble before the winde. Ier. 13. 24. 25. Hee <note place="margin">Ier. 13. 24. Ier. 18. 17.</note> ouerthroweth them in the day of battaile. Chap. 18. 17. But the moſt grieuous puniſhment of all is, that they ſhall beare their wickedneſſe, which is a burthen intollerable, and preſſeth all that are vnder it euen down to hell. Ezec. 23. 35. <note place="margin">Ezech. 23. 35.</note>
               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe it is puniſhed with eternall puniſhments; for as it is, Pſal. 9. 17. <hi>The wicked ſhall turne into hell, and all the nations that forget God.</hi> And therefore I conclude this point <note place="margin">Pſal. 9. 17. and 50. 22.</note> with the Pſalmiſt. Pſal. 50. 22. <hi>O conſider this O ye that forget God, leaſt I teare you in peeces and their be none to deliuer you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And theſe are thoſe puniſhments both temporall and eternall, which the Lord inflicteth vpon thoſe who forget his law; which that wee may auoyde, wee are not onely with all reuerence to heare and receiue the word of God, but alſo with all care and conſcience to treaſure it vp in our memories,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:10737:250"/> that ſo we may performe obedience therevnto in our liues and conuerſations, which if wee doe we ſhall be eternally bleſſed. Iam. 1. 25. <note place="margin">Iam. 1. 25.</note>
               </p>
               <p>To this purpoſe let vs briefly conſider of ſome meanes, <note place="margin">Of the meanes to help our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie &amp; auoid forgetfulneſſe.</note> whereby we may helpe our memories, and auoide this ſinne of forgetfulneſſe. The firſt is, that we prepare our ſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we heare the word of God, that our hearts may be fit grounds to receiue the ſeede of Gods word. And this is done firſt, by meditating vpon our ſinnes, which we deſire ſhould be mortified, and on thoſe vertues and graces, wherein wee are weake or wanting; and this will worke in vs an earneſt deſire to heare the word, which is the Phyſick that will cure our corruptions, &amp; the food which will nouriſh &amp; ſtrengthen vs in all grace and goodneſſe. Now thoſe who feede vpon this heauenly banquet with a hungry appetite, and a good ſtomacke, they will well digeſt it, and retaine this whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome nouriſhment; whereas they who heare the word and receiue this food with cloied appetites, they are ready as ſoone as they haue receyued it, to caſt it vp againe through for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfulneſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, before wee come, wee muſt purge our hearts from all maliciouſneſſe and filthineſſe, and remoue out of our minds all our worldly buſineſſes and diſtractions, which will choak in vs the ſeede of Gods word, and keepe vs from hearing and remembring it. If then we would keep and lock vp the treaſure of Gods word in the cheſt of our hearts, wee muſt firſt caſt out of it the baſe rags of worldly vanities, for God and Mammon, ſpirituall wiſdome and worldly profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, will neuer dwell together.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wee muſt before wee come haue recourſe vnto God by hearty prayer, deſiring him that with his holy ſpirit hee will not onely open our eares, that wee may reuerently heare his word, but alſo write it in our harts, ſo as it may ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be blotted out.</p>
               <p>So in the hearing of the word, we are to performe theſe dueties, if wee would retaine it in memorie: firſt, we muſt heare it with delight, for if with <hi>Dauid</hi> we <hi>delight our ſelues</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:10737:251"/> 
                  <hi>in Gods ſtatutes, then we will not forget his word.</hi> Pſal. 119. 16. <note place="margin">Pſal. 116. 16.</note> If we receiue it with joy, as being that precious pearle, which alone maketh rich, then our hearts will be fixed on it, <hi>for there as the treaſure is, there will the heart be alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, we muſt heare the word with great reuerence and attention, fixing our eyes on the teacher, as they on Chriſt, Luke. 4. 20. and our hearts vpon his words: and ſo <note place="margin">Luke. 4. 20.</note> that which is receiued with ſuch attentiue reuerence, will not eaſily ſlip out of memory.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we muſt obſerue the methode and order of our teacher, how he deuideth his Text into ſeuerall branches, and how he paſſeth from point to point: and ſo the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall points being remembred, will help vs to recall the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars vnder them contained; euen as the body of a Tree bringeth vs to the maine boughes; the boughes, to the braunches; and the braunches to the little ſprigges and leaues.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, after we haue heard the word we are to help our memories by prayer, meditation, and conference: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the foode of the word will be as meate vndigeſted, which cannot abide in the ſtomacke, or as the ſeede vncouered, which is deuoured of the fowles as ſoone as it falleth on the ground.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <p>ANd ſo much concernig the ſecond ſinne, laide to the charge of the Prieſts: the third followeth together with the puniſhment denounced againſt it. Verſe. 7. <hi>As they were</hi>

                  <hi>increaſed ſo they ſinned againſt mee; therefore will I change their glorie into ſhame.</hi> The which words containe two parts: <note place="margin">Expoſition.</note> firſt, the Prieſts ſinne: ſecondly, their puniſhment. Their ſinne was the vngratfull abuſe of Gods abundant bleſsings and rich mercies, multiplyed vpon them; in theſe wordes: <hi>As they were increaſed the more they ſinned againſt me.</hi> Where hee expreſſeth both the bleſsings multiplyed vpon the Prieſts, and their abuſe of them; the bleſsings in theſe words, <hi>as they were increaſed.</hi> Whereby is ſignified, not onely that the Lord had multiplyed the Prieſts in number, but alſo
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:10737:251"/> (and that as I take it more principally) that he had increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them in riches, power, and dignitie aboue the reſt of the people; the which extraordinary benefites, ſhould haue wrought in them an extraordinary meaſure of thankfulneſſe and care to glorifie God, ſeeing he was the ſole authour of all their preferment; as he alſo implyeth, whereas he ſaith, not that they had thus increaſed themſelues, but that they were increaſed, namely by the Lord their God.</p>
               <p>Their ſinne was their vngratefull abuſe of theſe benefits, in theſe words: <hi>So they ſinned againſt me,</hi> that is, the more I multiplyed my bleſsings vpon them, the more they multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed their ſinnes againſt me: for thus this word <hi>(So)</hi> is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken: as Exod. 1. 12. <hi>But as they vexed them ſo they</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 1. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>multiplyed,</hi> that is, the more they vexed them, the more they multiplyed, as our tranſlation alſo hath it. So in this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. Chap. 11. 2. <hi>They called them, ſo they went from them,</hi> that <note place="margin">Hoſ. 11. 2.</note> is, the more they called them, the more they went from them. This then was their ſinne, that whereas Gods liberall bounty towards them, ſhould haue made them thankfull to God, and zealous of his glory: contrariwiſe, his benefites made them wanton proud, and forgetfull of God; and not onely negligent of all good duetyes; but ready to commit any iniquitie and impietie againſt God. The which ſinne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it is odious in all, ſo eſpecially in the Prieſts, as ſome alſo thinke it is implyed in the words, <hi>againſt me,</hi> which they tranſlate, <hi>Sic peccauerunt mihi, they haue ſinned to me,</hi> wherby is intimated that the Prieſts ſins, who draw neere vnto God, and not onely profeſſe his law themſelues, but alſo teach others, do more neerely touch the Lord, diſhonor his name, and prouoke his wrath, then the ſins of the ordinarie people; euen as the crimes of a Steward whom his Lord putteth in truſt with the reſt of the familie, doe more diſcredite his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and incenſe his anger, then the faults of the common ſeruants.</p>
               <p>The puniſhment denounced againſt this ſinne is contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in theſe words: <hi>therefore I will change their glorie into ſhame;</hi> where by glory, we are to vnderſtand al thoſe benefits
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:10737:252"/> of riches, power and honour in which the Lord had increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them; all which he comprehendeth vnder the name glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, becauſe they were their glory, or the things wherein they chiefely gloryed. So, whereas he ſaith, that hee would turne their glory into ſhame, the meaning is, that he would depriue them of all theſe benefits belonging to the Prieſt-hood, and ſo expoſe them to ſhame &amp; reproach. As though he ſhould haue ſaid, becauſe you haue vngratefully abuſed all thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and prerogatiues which I haue endowed you with, aboue all the reſt of my people, and in ſtead of the fruits of loue, thankfulneſſe and obedience, haue taken occaſion by my benefits the more to diſhonour me, and to prouoke my diſpleaſure, by multiplying your ſinnes againſt me; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will ſtrip you vtterly of all my bleſsings, in which your chiefe glory conſiſteth, and ſo expoſe you to be ſcorned and deſpiſed of all who haue ſeene your paſſed glory, and now behold your preſent miſery.</p>
               <p>And this puniſhment was accordingly inflicted. Firſt, when as the Lord expoſed theſe ignorant Prieſts to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the people; but principally when as they were led into captiuitie, at what time not only the glory of the Prieſt-hood, but the Prieſt-hood it ſelfe ceaſed: and ſo they who were Captaines and leaders, became as common ſouldiers, yea, as miſerable captiues vnder their enimies, who had no reſpect of their place and calling.</p>
               <p>And ſo much for the meaning of the wordes: the <note place="margin">The priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie.</note> doctrines are theſe. Firſt, wee may obſerue that the Lord aduanceth his Prieſthood &amp; Miniſterie, and endoweth them with many ſingular prerogatiues and priuiledges, aboue the reſt of the people, as he noteth in this place: the which may further appeare if wee conſider their function and calling; for they are choſen of God to ſtand in his ſtead, to repreſent his owne perſon, and to performe his owne worke which himſelf performed vnto his Church in the dayes of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks, vntil <hi>Moſes</hi> time. For then the Lord taught them with his owne mouth, vntill the Iſraelites being terrified with his feareful voyce, earneſtly deſired that they might be informed
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:10737:252"/> in Gods will by the Miniſterie of men. Deut. 18. 18. So <note place="margin">Deut. 18. 18.</note> our Sauiour performed this office and function, whileſt he remayned on the earth; but when he aſcended into heauen he appointed his Miniſters to ſupply his place, &amp; to inſtruct his Church. Mat. 28. 19. So that now they are in his ſtead, <note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19.</note> and as his ambaſſadours doe deliuer the word of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto the people. 2 Cor. 5. 20. Whoſe voyce if the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 20.</note> here and obey, the Lord acknowledgeth that obedience as done to himſelfe; whom if they diſpiſe, he accounteth the contempt offered againſt his owne perſon. Luk. 10. 16. <note place="margin">Luk. 10. 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But their dignitie and the greatneſſe of their priuiledges <note place="margin">God Miniſters are his mouth to the people.</note> will better appeare, if wee conſider their office and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, and the titles wherewith in the Scriptures the holie ghoſt hath honoured them. For Firſt, in the Miniſterie of the word, they are the mouth of God to the people, and his ambaſſadours; who performe his owne worke; as it is, 1. <note place="margin">1. Cor. 16. 10.</note> Cor. 16. 10. euen the worke of reconciliation, juſtification, ſanctification and ſaluation. And therefore the Lord vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth them this dignitie to be called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Fellow</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>labourers with God,</hi> vnto whoſe moſt glorious and infinite Maieſtie, it is an aduancement aboue the worthyneſſe of the moſt excellent creature, to be acknowledged his meaneſt ſeruant.</p>
               <p>So in prayer, they are the mouth of the people vnto God, <note place="margin">The mouth of the people to God.</note> and as it were the ambaſſadours generall of the earth, by whom they make their ſuits knowne vnto God, intreat a ſupply of their wants, and returne thankſgiuing vnto the Lord for all his benefits.</p>
               <p>In like manner the Lord hath committed vnto them the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, which are the ſeales of his <note place="margin">They are the keepers of Gods ſeales the Sacarments</note> couenant; whereby all his gracious promiſes, are ratified &amp; confirmed vnto vs; ſo that as in reſpect of the rich treaſure of Gods word, committed to their diſpoſing, they are the Lords treaſurers; ſo in reſpect of the Sacraments, they are the keepers of his great ſeales. Now if theſe offices be great vnder mortall Princes, in corruptible thinges: how are theſe officers aduanced who are vnder in theſe places the King of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:10737:253"/> Kings? who diſpence not tranſitorie trifles, but heauenly treaſures; nor ſeale aſſurances of earthly patrimonies, but of an eternall inheritance and a moſt glorious kingdome.</p>
               <p>But come we from their office to their titles, and we ſhall <note place="margin">The titles giuen to the Miniſterie.</note> find that they are much aduanced aboue others: For the reſt of Gods people are called his ſeruants, theſe his ſtewards, Luk. 12 42. who haue the cuſtodie of his keyes committed <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 42.</note> vnto them, that they may releeue thoſe of the familie who are obedient out of their ſtore, and ſhut the ſtubborne and rebellious out of the doores. Mat. 16. 19. They are called the <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 19.</note> Lords ſheepe, theſe the ſhepheards. Ezech. 34. 2. They the <note place="margin">Ezech. 34. 2.</note> Lords corne and harueſt, theſe his husbandmen, Mat. 9. 37. <note place="margin">Mat. 9. 37.</note> They the Lords Plants in his garden, Cant. 4. 13. theſe his <note place="margin">Cant. 4. 13.</note> gardeners who plant &amp; water them, 1 Cor. 3. 6. They liuing ſtones in the temple of God, theſe maiſter builders, 1 Cor. 3. <note place="margin">1. Cor. 3. 6. and 3. 9.</note> 9. who finiſh this worke and bring it to perfection, Ephe. 4. 12. 13. They children in Gods familie, theſe ſpirituall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 12. 13.</note> who by the ſeede of the word beget them vnto God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 Cor. 4. 15. <note place="margin">1. Cor. 4. 15.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And theſe were the ſpirituall prerogatiues, with which <note place="margin">The temporall priuiledges of the Miniſterie</note> the Lord hath endowed his Prieſthood and Miniſterie; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides which hee allotted vnto them many temporall priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges; as for example, the double honour of reuerence and maintenance: for in reſpect of the firſt, none were in greater honour &amp; account among the people, next vnder the King, then the Lords Prieſts: and for the other none more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully maintayned then they, who had not onely the tithes, but the firſt fruits, oblations, and daily ſacrifices; all which they had not at the peoples deuotions, but chalenged them in Gods right as being his portion, which when he gaue vnto them the land he reſerued for himſelfe. Neither is the Lords liberalitie ſhortened towards his Miniſters in the time of the Goſpell, for he hath commanded the people to giue vnto them <hi>double honour:</hi> the honour of reuerence, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of maintenance, as appeareth, 1 Tim. 5. 17. 18. For if <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 17. 18.</note> the Lords care were ſuch both for the honour and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the legall Miniſtrie and Prieſthood, which was the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:10737:253"/> Miniſterie of the letter which killeth, the Miniſtrie of death and condemnation; how much more that the Miinſterie of the new couenant, which <hi>is the Miniſterie of the ſpirit that giueth life, and the Miniſterie of righteouſneſſe,</hi> (that is, whereby we of ſinners are made righteous) <hi>ſhould excell in glorie,</hi> as the Apoſtle reaſoneth. 2 Cor. 3. 6. 7. 8. 9. <note place="margin">2. Cor. 3. 6 7.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The vſe of this doctrine reſpecteth both Miniſters and people: the Miniſters, firſt, for inſtruction; that ſeeing the Lord hath aduanced them to ſuch Honour and Dignitie, they walke worthy this high calling, thinking no paines too much which they ſhall take for the aduancement of Gods glory, who hath ſo exceedingly honoured them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for their conſolation &amp; encouragement againſt all <note place="margin">Conſolation for Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters againſt contempt.</note> the miſerie, pouertie, reproch &amp; contempt which they ſuffer in this life. For though outwardly they are poore and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all worldly pompe, yet they are like the Kings daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, all glorious within; though they are deſpiſed of men, yet they are highly eſteemed before God; though the world eſteemeth them as the very ofscouring of all things, yet the Lord hath choſen them to be his chiefe Officers, his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, his Stewards, his Keepers of the ineſtimable Treaſure of his Word, and of his great ſeales, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Baptiſme and the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p>The vſe which concerneth the people is, that they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <note place="margin">The people ought to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Gods Miniſters.</note> them whom God thus honoureth, and that they behaue themſelues towards their Miniſters, as it becommeth the reſt of the familie to behaue themſelues towards the ſteward or Treaſurer; the people towards the Ambaſſadour; yea the children towards their fathers. For looke what honor is done vnto them, as being Gods Ambaſſadours, that the Lord accounterh as done vnto himſelfe, whoſe perſon they ſuſtain; looke what diſgrace and reproach is offred againſt them as being his Miniſters, the Lord eſteemeth it as offred againſt himſelfe, and therefore will neuer let it goe vnpuniſhed, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this life or in the life to come: for if <hi>Dauid</hi> could not endure thoſe inſolent abuſes which were by <hi>Hanun</hi> offered <note place="margin">2. Sam. 10.</note> againſt his Ambaſſadours, whom in loue and kindneſſe he
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:10737:254"/> ſent vnto him, but reuenged them with the death and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a great part of the people of <hi>Ammon:</hi> how much leſſe can the Lord endure that reproach, injuries &amp; outrages, ſhould be offred againſt his Ambaſſadors, and not reuenge theſe indignities, which are not ſo much offred againſt men, as in them againſt himſelfe? Fearefull examples hereof wee haue in the Scriptures, as in the conſpiracy of <hi>Corah</hi> and his aſſociates, whom the earth ſwallowed quick. Numb. 16. In <note place="margin">Numb. 6. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> whoſe hand was withered vp for the contempt and violence which he offred againſt the Lords Prophet. 1 Kin. <note place="margin">1. King. 13.</note> 13. In the two Captaines &amp; their fifties, who were deſtroyed with fire from heauen, becauſe they came not to the Lords Prophet, with that ſubmiſsiue reuerence which beſeemed them. 2 King. 1. 9. 10. 11. 12.

               <p>The ſecond thing to be obſerued is the gorſe ingratitude <note place="margin">Our vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full abuſe of Gods benefits.</note> of our corrupt natures: whereby it commeth to paſſe that the more God multiplyeth his mercies, the more ready we are to rebell againſt him, and to prouoke his wrath by our ſinnes; for whereas Gods manifould benefits multiplyed vpon vs ſhould make vs to humble our ſelues before him, in that he hath made vs ſo deepely indebted to his infinite goodneſſe; we contrariwiſe abuſing them, make them ſerue as ſo many ſteps whereby we may aſcend into the ſeate of pride; whereas they ſhould ſerue as ſo many common places to put vs in minde of Gods gracious goodnes towards vs; we abuſing them are made hereby more forgetfull of God, as though now being throughly furniſht, vve had no further neede of his helpe; vvhereas they ſhould ſerue as ſo many motiues to ſtirre vs vp to holy obedience, that thereby vvee may glorifie God, the author of all our good; vve hereby grow more vndutifull, like cockred children towards their Parents, or pampred horſes towards their maiſters, and are
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:10737:254"/> more ready to fall into the ſinnes of pride, voluptuouſneſſe, loue of the world, profaneneſſe, and vtter neglect of religion and all religious dueties; whereas the abundance of Gods bleſsings vvhich vve injoy, ſhould make vs to pittie, and take compaſsion on thoſe who want them, they abuſed through our corruption, doe make vs to diſdaine &amp; contemne them; furious and cruell in reuenge, and inſolent in offring wrongs and injuries. And hence it is that the Lord doth ſo carefully vvarne the Iſraelites, that when they did injoy all the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of Canaan, they ſhould not forget and rebell againſt him. Deut. 6. 10. 11. 12. Into vvhich ſinne they ſhamefully <note place="margin">Deut. 6. 10. 11. Pſal. 62. 10. 1. Tim. 6. 17.</note> fell, notwithſtanding they were thus admoniſhed. So Pſal. 62. 10. 1 Tim. 6. 17. Examples of this vngratefull abuſe of Gods bleſsing, we haue in <hi>Saul, Ieroboam, Naball, Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hoſ. 10. 1. and 13. 6.</note> the people of Iſraell: but neuer vvas age more fruitfull of theſe examples, neuer land more plentifull in theſe vngratefull preſidents, then this of ours; wherein the more the bleſsings of God abound, the more pride, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of God, contempt of Religion, and the vtter neglect of all holy duties abound likewiſe; ſo that hard it is to finde a man bettered by Gods benefits; or more zealous of Gods glory, the more bleſsings they receiue from him; but contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe the more they abound in honors, riches, peace, health, and all kind of proſperity, the more they ſhew their profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, irreligion, worldlines and vtter neglect of all holy duties.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this doctrine is, firſt, that ſeeing through our corruption we are ſo apt to abuſe Gods bleſsings, we be made hereby more watchfull ouer our owne hearts, when wee are in proſperitie, that we be not ouertaken with this vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and that wee bee no more earneſt in begging theſe temporary benefits, then in praying alſo for an holy vſe of them, that they may ſerue as helps and furtherances vnto vs in all holy and Chriſtian dueties: for if the more we abound in them, the more we abound in ſinne againſt God, then doe they ceaſe to bee bleſsings and benefits, and become ſnares to intangle vs, and thornes to choak in vs all vertue and godlineſſe.</p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:10737:255"/>
               <p> Secondly, that we arme our ſelues with patience, when as wee are not ſo much increaſed in theſe temporall benefits, ſeeing the Lord herein reſpecteth the good of his children, and with-holdeth worldly bleſsings from them, becauſe hee knoweth they would abuſe them vnto ſinne.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that we be not vexed out of meaſure with impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiencie, when as thoſe of whom we haue beſt deſerued, doe ſhew themſelues vngratefull to vs, conſidering that wee continually ſhew our ſelues much more vnthankfull againſt God, vnto whom we are infinitely more indebted.</p>
               <p>The third thing to be obſerued is, that the Lord condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <note place="margin">Vngratefulnes condemned as a great ſinne.</note> this vngratefull abuſe of his bleſsings and benefits, as a great ſinne, not onely in this, but alſo in many other places, So Eſay. 1. 2. 3. he condemneth it as a vice worſe then bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, <note place="margin">Eſay. 1. 2. 3. &amp; 5. 5.</note> Eſay. 5. 5. he complaineth that when he had done what hee could for his vineyard, yet ſtill it brought forth wilde grapes: ſo Ezech. 16. 16. 17. that the people abuſed his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings <note place="margin">Ezech. 16. 16.</note> as meanes to further them in Idolatry. So Hoſ. 10. 1. <note place="margin">Hoſ. 10. 1. and 13. 6.</note> and 13. 6. But as this ſinne is in all men grieuous, ſo it is in Gods Miniſters moſt haynous, both becauſe the bleſsings which they injoy being extraordinary, doe require extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie thankfulneſſe, and alſo in that they are daylie infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med out of Gods word, both whence they haue theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites, and that the Lord for all, onely requireth a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full heart, wee hauing nothing elſe to returne vnto him.</p>
               <p>Now this vnthankfull abuſe of Gods benefits vnto ſinne, <note place="margin">Ingratitude di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers wayes committed.</note> is committed diuers wayes. Firſt, when as wee doe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God the authour of the benefits which we injoy, but aſcribe them vnto ſome other things; as vnto Idols, an example vvhereof vvee haue in the Iſraelites, Ierem. 44. 17. <note place="margin">Ier. 44. 17. Hoſ. 2. 5. 8.</note> Hoſ. 2. 5. 8. or vnto a mans owne wit, power, induſtrie, and labour, an example whereof vvee haue in the King of Aſhur, Eſay. 10. 13. and in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> Dan 4. 27. <note place="margin">Eſay. 10. 13. Dan. 4. 27. Hab. 1. 16.</note> and this is to <hi>ſacrifice to our owne nets,</hi> as is is. Hab. 1. 16.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when as knowing God to be the authour of the bleſsings which we enjoy, we doe not praiſe him with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hearts, nor imploy his gifts to the aduancement of his
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:10737:255"/> glory, which are the chiefe ends for which he hath beſtowed them. Pſal. 105. 45. <note place="margin">Pſal. 105. 45.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, vvhen as vve abuſe Gods bleſsings as meanes and motiues to with-draw vs from performing the dueties which God requireth of vs, and to incite vs to the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the contrary vices. As vvhen by Gods bleſsings vvee are made more ſlack and negligent in the dueties of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſeruice, as thoſe are who to maintaine ſtate, come not to the aſſemblies of Gods Saints, to heare the Word, and call vpon his name, when as injoying proſperitie we be moued thereby to with-draw our hearts from God, and to ſet them vpon the world; when as honours make vs neglect him who hath aduanced vs; when as riches like thorns choak in vs the ſeede of the word, ſo as Gods ſpirituall graces can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpring in vs; when as injoying pleaſures, we wallow in theſe worldly delights, and ſpend that precious time wholy in them, which ſhould bee beſtowed in Gods ſeruice; when as by worldly proſperitie we are made more proud, inſolent, diſdainefull, impatient, reuengefull, cruell, vnmercifull, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous, ſpending we care not what vpon back, belly, and vpon the filthy luſts of the fleſh. And this is the chiefe and moſt vngratefull abuſe of Gods benefits, when as we doe not onely not glorifie him, but diſhonour and injure him in his owne gifts, as if the poore Subject being inriched by his Prince, ſhould imploy his riches in furniſhing himſelfe for the ſeruice of the Princes enimie: or as if the wife hauing from her husband abundance of all things, ſhould abuſe his gifts for the hiring and rewarding of filthy adulterers, as <note place="margin">Ezech. 16. 16 17. 33. The ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of this land.</note> it is. Ezech. 16. 16. 17. 33.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this doctrine ſerueth to conuince the greateſt part of our land, of this ſinne of vnthankfulneſſe, ſeeing the more the Lord multiplyeth his benefits of peace, proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and abundance of all good things, the more we multiply our ſins, abuſing his grace vnto wantonneſſe, and his mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold bleſsings, as arguments to continue vs in our impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie, ſecuritie and hardneſſe of hart. For are not thoſe moſt colde in all dueties of religion, who moſt abound with theſe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:10737:256"/> benefites? doe they not choake the ſeed of the Word in the moſt, and make it vnfruitfull? and in ſtead of louing and prayſing God the more for his bleſsings, doe not men hereby grovv louers of the world, and forgetfull of God? doe not thoſe vvho abound moſt in wealth, honours, and pleaſures, imploy all to the diſhonour of God and the ſeruice of ſinne and ſathan, ſpending Gods gifts in pride, exceſsiue braue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ſurfetting, drunkenneſſe and filthy luſts of the fleſh, ſo that the Lord may in our time juſtly take vp this complaint of England, that the more he hath increaſed it in his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits the more it hath ſinned againſt him.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing to be obſerued is, the puniſhment of this vngratefull abuſe of Gods bleſsings, and that is whereſoeuer <note place="margin">The puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</note> Gods gifts are thus abuſed by any, there he will ſtrip them of them; and not onely ſo, but will alſo bring vpon them the contrarie euils: as in this place, becauſe they abuſed their honour and aduancement, hee doth not onely threaten to take it from them, but to turne it into ſhame and reproach. So he threatneth his vineyard, that becauſe in ſtead of the ſweete grapes of righteouſneſſe, it brought forth nothing but the ſower grapes of ſinne, after he had beſtowed all his coſt and labour about it, he would not onely abandon and let it alone, but pull downe the hedge, and lay it waſte to be deuoured of the beaſts of the field. So when as the children <note place="margin">Eſay. 5.</note> of Iſraell, were not moued by Gods benefits to loue and obedience, but ſinned and prouoked him with their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions; he doth not onely with-draw his bleſsings, but his wrath being inflamed againſt them he bringeth vpon them his fearefull judgements: Wherevpon one maketh this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, <hi>Quantò maiora beneficia ſunt hominibus conſtituta, tantò grauiora peccantibus iudicia:</hi> the greater benefits that <note place="margin">Chryſo. ſuper Math.</note> wee receiue from God, the greater ſhall bee our puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, if we abuſe them vnto ſinne. Mat. 11. 21. <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 21.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is, that ſeeing the Lord with a liberall hand <note place="margin">That we muſt returne thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes to God for his benefits</note> hath ſowen the ſeed of his benefits amongſt vs, wee returne vnto him the harueſt of loue, obedience, and thankfulneſſe; otherwiſe if wee vnthankfully abuſe Gods bleſsings vnto
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:10737:256"/> ſinne, the Lord will not onely ſtrip vs of them, but alſo bring vpon vs the contrary euils: he vvill turne our peace into war, our libertie into tharldome, our health into ſickneſſe, our plentie into penurie &amp; vvant, our glory into ſhame, and that vvhich vve moſt feare ſhall come vpon vs: or elſe vvhich is worſt of all, if he continue theſe his gifts, yet he vvill make them of bleſsings curſes, of benefits puniſhments, by giuing vs ouer to our owne wayes, and ſuffering vs to goe on as in all other our ſinnes, ſo namely in this horrible abuſe of his benefits, in the ſecuritie and hardneſſe of our owne harts, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he attach vs by death, and call vs to a reckoning before his ſeate of judgement, hovv vve haue ſpent, and vvhat vſe vve haue made of his talents, vvhen as not being able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere one vvord, vve ſhall be bound hand and foote, and caſt into vtter darkneſſe, where ſhall be vveeping and gnaſhing <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 30.</note> of teeth.</p>

               <p>And firſt vve are to enquire vvhat is meant by eating the ſinnes of the people; for the vnderſtanding vvhereof we are to know that in many places of the Scripture, ſinne is put for the ſacrifices, vvhich vvere offred for ſinne: So Exod 29. 14 <note place="margin">Exod. 29. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>But the fleſh of the Calfe, and his skinne, and his dung, ſhalt thou burne with ſire without the boaſt, it is ſinne,</hi> that is, a ſinne Offering. So Leu. 10. 17. <hi>Wherefore haue yee not eaten the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Leu. 10. 17</note> 
                  <hi>ſinne,</hi> (that is, the ſinne offrings) <hi>in the holy place.</hi> And in this ſenſe Chriſt is ſaid to be <hi>made ſinne for vs.</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 21. that <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 21.</note> is, an oblation, for our ſinnes, for the ſatisfying of his fathers juſtice, and the appeaſing of his wrath. In which ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we are here to take it, ſo that by eating the ſinnes of the people, is meant, the eating of their ſacrifices vvhich were offred for their ſinnes.</p>
               <p>But it may be demaunded, how this is imputed vnto them as a ſinne, to eate theſe ſacrifices, ſeeing it was the portion of the Prieſts which was allotted vnto them by gods own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, as appeareth Leu. 6. 25. 26. 29. Vnto vvhich <note place="margin">Leu. 6. 25. 26. 29.</note> I anſwere, that they ſinned in that theſe ſacrifices did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto them; ſeeing they were appropriated vnto Gods true Prieſts and Leuites, vvhich inſtructed the people, and vvorſhipped God in the Temple at Ieruſalem, according to his commandement: But theſe vvere <hi>Ieroboams</hi> Prieſts, cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of the baſeſt of people of other Tribes, vvho being ignorant themſelues, vtterly neglected the duty of teaching the people; neither did they offer the ſacrifices in the place appoynted for Gods vvorſhip, but in the high places of Dan and Bethell. Secondly, in that in theſe ſacrifices they aymed not at the glory of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor the good of the people: not at Gods glory, for they did not ſo much offer theſe ſacrifices, that God thereby might be worſhipped and ſerued, as that they might hereby ſerue their owne turnes, and make large prouiſion for their owne bellies; neyther did they reſpect the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:10737:257"/> peoples good, for ſo they would bring ſtore of Sacrifices, &amp; oblations, vvhereby they might haue abundance of prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to mainetaine them in idlenes and voluptuouſneſſe, they were content to vvinck at their corruptions, to flatter them in their ſinnes, to be altogether ſilent in admonitions and reproofes, and to perſwade them, that though they liued in their ſinnes, yet God would be well pleaſed and fully ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, if they brought their ſacrifices to make their attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Whereby the people were moued to goe on in their ſinnes without repentance, and to reſt in the deede done, as though that were ſufficient for their ſaluation. By vvhich their doctrine and practiſe they vtterly peruerted the right end and vſe of the Sacrifices, which were inſtituted of God to bring the people to repentance and faith. For firſt when the beaſt was to be ſlaine, they were injoyned to lay their hands on the head thereof, that hereby they might acknowledge and profeſſe, that themſelues had by their ſinnes juſtly deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that death which the poore beaſt ſuffered, yea, euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting death of body and ſoule; to the end that hereby their hearts might be pricked, and their conſciences woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the conſideration of their ſinnes, and the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Gods juſtice and ſeuere wrath againſt them; and ſo be brought to mourne and bewaile their ſinnes paſt, and to a ſetled purpoſe and reſolution not to fall into them againe for the time to come. For which end alſo God appoynted theſe ſacrifices as a certaine mulct and penaltie for ſinne, that by this coſt and charge they might be reſtrained from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting theſe ſinnes, vvhich muſt be thus dearely expiated. Againe, wheras it vvas impoſsible that the bloud of Buls and Goats ſhould purge away ſinne, hereby they vvere brought as by certaine types vnto Ieſus Chriſt, who was the Lambe ſlaine from the beginning of the vvorld, by whoſe bloud alone they were to haue redemption and remiſsion of ſinne.</p>
               <p>But this doctrine they eyther knew not, or knowing it, they concealed it, as making much againſt their profit, and taught the people to reſt in the outward Sacrifices as in the deede done, whereby they were not reſtrayned but rather
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:10737:258"/> incouraged to liue in ſinne, ſeeing ſuch eaſie remedies vvere prouided for them. And hence it is that the Lord vſeth this metaphor of eating the ſinnes of the people, to ſignifie their eating of the ſacrifices offered for ſinne; becauſe whilſt they receiued their offerings they wincked at their ſinnes, neuer giuing them any admonition or reproofe, but rather incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging them in their wickedneſſe, by putting them in hope of pardon for the oblations ſake; they hereby turned their ſacrifices into ſinne, and might fitly be ſayd to feed vpon the ſinnes of the people, which they ſwallowed in ſilence for their owne profit.</p>
               <p>And thus haue I ſhewed their luxurious pampering of themſelues in eaſe and bellie-cheare, ſignified in the firſt words. Their greedy auarice, vvhereby they maintained themſelues in theſe luxurious courſes, may partly appeare by that which hath beene ſaide, but is more plainely expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the words following: <hi>And they lift vp their mindes vnto their iniquitie,</hi> that is, they not onely curiouſly obſerue what ſinnes are committed by the people, but alſo earneſtly deſire that they may offend, that out of their falls they may raiſe their owne gaine and aduantage. So that in this place to lift vp their mindes vnto their iniquitie, is to expect, and as it were to gape after their ſinnes as after a pray, which they earneſtly couet to ſeaze vpon. And thus this phraſe is vſed in other places, as Deut. 24. 15. Where it is ſaid, that <note place="margin">Deut. 24. 15.</note> they ſhould not delay to pay the workmans hire, becauſe he is poore, <hi>and lifteth vp his minde vnto it</hi> (for ſo the words are) that is, earneſtly expecteth, and wholy dependeth vpon it, becauſe by it his life is ſuſtained. So Ier. 22. 27. <hi>But vnto</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 22. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>the land where vnto they lift vp their mindes that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, they ſhall not returne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſinne therefore of the Prieſts which is here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned is, that they deſired the people ſhould commit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinnes, that ſo they might receiue the benefit of many ſacrifices, and being thus inriched, might ſpend their time in idleneſſe and luxuriouſneſſe; the which was an abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable wickedneſſe againſt God; for their allowance vvas
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:10737:258"/> graunted vnto them, that they ſhould reſtraine the people from ſinne by their inſtructions, admonitions and reproofes; and therefore they were to receiue their carnall things, that they might communicate vnto them ſpirituall things, and howſoeuer they gayned by the ſacrifices offred for ſinne, yet they ſhould not haue delighted in their ſinnes, nay they ſhould haue mourned for them, and euen haue groned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their burthen, to which end the ſinne offering was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them, as appeareth, Leu. 10. 17. for ſo he ſaith, that <note place="margin">Leu. 10. 17.</note> the ſinne Offring was giuen the Prieſts, <hi>that they ſhould beare the iniquitie of the Congregation, and make an attonement for them before the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But theſe wicked Prieſts were ſo farre from reſtrayning the people from ſinne, that they incouraged them vnto wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, by extenuating their offences, and offering vnto them a ſpeedy and eaſier remedy; namely, that if hauing ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they would come and offer their ſacrifices for ſinne, God would reſt ſatisfied, and receiue them into former fauor; and ſo far were they from grieuing for their transgreſsions, that they deſired earneſtly that they might trangreſſe, and expected their falls, as wholy depending vpon them for their gaine and aduantage.</p>
               <p>To conclude all in a ſhort ſumme, the ſinnes whereof the Prieſts are here accuſed are, that they gaue themſelues to idleneſſe and belly-cheare, and turned the Sacrifices into a pray, wherewith they pampred themſelues; and to the end that they might receiue theſe oblations in more abundance, they wincked at the peoples ſinnes, neuer admoniſhing nor rebuking them for them, but rather deſired they ſhould ſin that they might offer the more Sacrifices: poſſeſsing them with this conceipt, that God required no more, but that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſinned, they ſhould by their oblations make ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Wherby they incouraged them vnto wickedneſſe, ſeeing hauing ſatisfied their luſts by committing ſin, there was no more to be done for expiation, but to bring new ſacrifices, &amp; ſo they might againe renew their ſins, as oft as they pleaſed, ſo they would alſo renew their ſacrifices and oblations.</p>
               <pb n="184" facs="tcp:10737:259"/>
               <p> And this is the meaning of the words: the doctrines to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The doctrines. </seg>
                  </label> be obſerued out of them are theſe. Firſt, wee may note, that <note place="margin">That it is a great ſinne to receiue the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the duties.</note> the Lord condemneth it as a great ſinne, when a man ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth vpon the profits which belong vnto his calling, &amp; ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them in luxuriouſneſſe and belly-cheare, in the meane time vtterly neglecting the duties of his calling, for this was the ſinne of the Prieſts in this place. The reaſon hereof is. Firſt, becauſe where the reward and profit of the calling is giuen vpon condition of the performance of the dueties of the calling, there if the dueties be neglected, and the profits receiued, it is eſteemed no better then theft in Gods ſight, becauſe they are vſurped without any right, ſeeing they are not granted abſolutely, but vpon condition of the duty which is neglected: as if the ſouldier receiuing pay from his prince, doe ſpend it vpon his luſts, and is neuer ready to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his enimies; and the ſeruant wages from his maiſter and neuer performe any ſeruice vnto him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe the end of our callings and the profits of them, is not that we ſhould pamper our ſelues in eaſe, and ſatisfie our luſts, but that we ſhould by the performance of our duties glorifie God, and further the good of the Church and common wealth, which who ſo neglects, they are like vnprofitable Drones, who gather no hony, but liue at eaſe and feed themſelues with others labours.</p>
               <p>Examples of this ſinne we haue in <hi>Eſau,</hi> who ſpent all his time in hunting, which ſhould haue beene imployed in the duties of his calling. In the Sodomits, who ſpent their wealth in pride and pleaſures, eating and drinking, idlenes and lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vriouſneſſe, and wholy neglected the reliefe of the poore. Ezech. 16. 49. In the Idoll ſhepheards, who ſleeced their <note place="margin">Ezech. 19. 49. and 34. 2.</note> ſheepe, and fed vpon the milke, but did not feed the flocke, Ezech. 34. 2. And in the euill ſeruant, who ſeazed vpon the reward due to the ſteward, and ſpent it in eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but neglected the duties which he owed, both to his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and the family.

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:10737:259"/> out of the Churches ſtocke, doe cloyſter vp themſelues in their Monaſteries, and ſpend their time in idleneſſe and lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriouſneſſe, performing no dutie neither to Church nor common wealth; ſo alſo it ſerueth for the juſt reproofe of many amongſt our ſelues; as of Magiſtrats, who being li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally maintayned at the charge of the common wealth, do neglect the duties of gouernment and executing juſtice, and ſpend their time in pleaſures and idleneſſe. So alſo of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, who ſeaze vpon the preferments of the Church but doe not labour in the worke of the Miniſterie: And laſtly, of vnprofitable gentlemen, who injoying the fat of the land, doe ſpend it in pride, exceſſe, and voluptuous liuing, but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme no good dutie either to Church or common wealth. All which haue a fearefull accompt to make at the day of judgement, ſeeing they take the Lords liberall wages, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming no ſeruice for it, but waſtfully miſpend it about the ſatisfying of their owne ſinfull luſts; let not therefore ſuch men flatter themſelues with a conceipt, that what they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy is their owne, and that they may doe with their owne what they liſt, for it is not their owne abſolutely, but onelie on this condition that they performe the duties of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of which it is the reward, and it is then onely lawfull for vs to eate our bread, when as we haue earned it with the ſweate of our browes, Gen. 3. 19. Neither ought we to ſpend <note place="margin">Gen. 3. 19.</note> theſe gifts of God, for the ſatisfying of our owne ſinfull luſts, ſeeing they are his Talents which he hath giuen vs to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, for the aduancing of his owne glorie, and the good of our fellow ſeruants.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be obſerued is, that howſoeuer theſe <note place="margin">Men reſpect their owne cauſe more then Gods.</note> Prieſts did eaſily remit Gods right, ſo farre forth as it did not concerne their owne worldly profit, and were ſo meale mouthed that they durſt not ſpeake againſt the peoples ſinnes, whereby his holy name was diſhonoured, yet they would looſe none of their owne right in their ſacrifices and oblations: whence vve may diſcerne a notable corruption that is in vs, which is our ſingular partiality in reſpecting our own cauſe more then the cauſe of God: for when the matter
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:10737:260"/> concerneth him, wee are verie remiſſe, cold, and eaſie to be intreated, but when it concerneth our ſelues, verie earneſt hote and inexorable: For example, the Magiſtrate makes lawes for the maintenance of his owne right, ſtate, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and being made doth moſt ſtraightly execute them, but either he maketh no lawes at all to repreſſe thoſe ſins which immediately impeach Gods glory, or if their be any made yet he is verie remiſſe in the execution: many Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are very ſlacke and timerous in rebuking of ſinne, for feare of diſpleaſing their pariſhioners, but if any part of their owne right or duties, be with-held from them, they ſhew themſelues bould and reſolute for the recouerie of it, though it be with the diſpleaſure of the greateſt; many mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſuffer their ſeruants to vſe ſwearing and blaſphemie, pretending they are ſo vnruly that they can beare no ſway with them, neither with their perſwaſions nor rebukes, but if they offer vnto them any wrong or damage, then they ſhew themſelues men of abſolute authoritie in inflicting vpon the offender ſharp puniſhment; ſo they can eaſilie diſpence with their ſeruants for the breaking of the Sabbath, and paſſe ouer the matter from themſelues, by pretending that they would willingly bring them to the Church, and haue them to obſerue a holy reſt, but they are ſo ſtubborne and wilfull, that they cannot reſtraine them from their vaine and vnlawfull ſports; and yet theſe men who can beare no rule with their ſeruants on the Lord day, haue authoritie and alſo vſe it all the ſix dayes of the vveeke, to keepe them from theſe vnlawfull paſtimes, and to make them to follow their worldly buſineſſe; and where is the cauſe of this great difference, ſurely not in the ſeruant, who might as eaſily be brought, to ſit in the Church on the Lords day, as to work painefully in his trade all the vveeke, but the fault lyeth vpon the maiſter, who is ſo earneſtly reſolute for the diſpatch of his owne buſineſſe, that he will admit of no deniall or excuſe; whereas contrariwiſe either he careleſly permitteth his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants when the Lords day commeth to doe what they lift, or dealeth ſo coldly and remiſly on Gods behalfe, as if
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:10737:260"/> though he doe ſpeake, he did not greatly care whether his ſpeach be regarded or no: ſo when men ſee Gods name diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured by any ſin, they are ſo baſhfull and timerous, that they are hardly moued to ſpeak in Gods cauſe, but if their owne name be traduced, and their credit impeached in any company, they ſhew themſelues furiouſly violent in remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the imputation. The cauſe hereof is, our coldneſſe in the loue of God, and our too much ſelfe loue, which maketh men thinke all too much which they doe for Gods ſake, and all too little which they can doe for themſelues; for if there were not this exceeding partialitie in our affections, wee would neuer ſhew our ſelues ſo partiall in our actions.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is, that ſeeing our corruption, we labour to reforme it; and to this end, we muſt continually endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to abate the inordinate loue of our ſelues, and to increaſe in our harts that heauenly loue of God; and ſo ſhall we grow more milde and moderate in our owne cauſe, and more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uently zealous in the cauſe of God, according to the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Moſes,</hi> who in matters which concerned himſelfe, was <note place="margin">Num. 12. 1.</note> the meekeſt man vpon the earth, and was eaſily inclined to put vp wrongs, and to depart from his right; but when he was to deale for God, he tooke vpon him an holy obſtinacy, ſo as hee would not conſent vnto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that ſo much as a hoofe ſhould remaine behinde them, Exo. 10. 26. and ſhewed <note place="margin">Exod. 10. 26.</note> himſelfe religiouſly cruell, in ſlaying ſome of the Idolaters, and cauſing others to drinke the aſhes of the Idoll. Exod. <note place="margin">Exo. 32. 20. 27</note> 32. 20. 27. The like mildneſſe and patience ſhewed <hi>Samuel,</hi> when his juſt gouernement was rejected by the inconſtant people; and the like feruent zeale and holy anger, when hee was to deale in Gods cauſe againſt <hi>Agag</hi> the enimie of the Church, and in reprouing <hi>Saul</hi> (notwithſtanding that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him) for tranſgreſsing Gods commandement. 1 Sam 15 <note place="margin">1 Sam. 15. 23. 33.</note> 23. 26. 28. 33.</p>
               <p>The third thing to be obſerued is, that the Prophet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <note place="margin">Luxurious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ity and greedy coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe often goe together.</note> firſt accuſed them of liuing idlely in luxurious exceſſe, vnder the phraſe of eating the ſinnes of the people, doth in the next place condemne them of greedy couetouſneſſe
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:10737:261"/> and vnlawfull avarice, whereby they deſired to inrich them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, euen by the ſinnes of the people, that ſo they might maintaine their waſtfull and profuſe expences, about their pleaſures and belly-cheare. And indeed fitly are theſe joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together in the reproofe, ſeeing they are ſeldome ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the offender; for idleneſſe and luxurious exceſſe, is the mother which breedeth and bringeth forth vnlawfull coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, and this wicked auarice is the nurſe of this exceſſe and idleneſſe. When as men addict themſelues vnto idlenes, neglecting the duties of their callings, and yet will maintaine their port aboue their pitch, and waſtfully ſpend in pride, pleaſure, and belly-cheare, aboue their meanes, then muſt they of neceſsitie fall to plotting and deuiſing, how they may haue extraordinary ſupply by wicked and vnlawful meanes, when as thoſe which are honeſt and approuable faile them; then they begin to couet other mens goods, and to plot meanes how they may compaſſe them; then they fall to ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, purloyning, bribing, oppreſsing, couſening, deceiuing and what not, that they may inrich themſelues &amp; maintaine their exceſſe and pleaſure. Thus Magiſtrates conſume their people with tributes and taxations, that hereby they may maintaine their exceſſe and waſtfull expences. Thus Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters heape liuing vpon liuing, becauſe they cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to liue frugally within their compaſſe, but muſt maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a port and ſtate aboue their lawfull meanes, that by their profuſe hoſpitality, they may aduance their credit, and ſo ruſh into forbidden paſtures, being not content to feed in the circuit of their own tether. So Gentlemen, that they may maintaine themſelues, their wiues, and children, in exceſsiue and almoſt princely brauery, are driuen to increaſe their fines, and inhaunſe their rents to exceſsiue rates, and when all this is not ſufficient to defray their charges, they are faine to giue ouer hoſpitalitie, and to hide themſelues in corners to ſaue expences. And thus alſo Citizens vying with one another, who ſhall exceede in pride and exceſſe, and not being able to maintaine themſelues in this courſe by their lawfull gaines and honeſt labours, are driuen to vſe all manner of fraud
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:10737:261"/> and deceipt in buying and ſelling, ſubtill ſlights, and indirect wayes; and when all this will not ſerue the turne, they are at the laſt conſtrayned to breake and become bankrupts, either vtterly ruined in their eſtates, or that which is worſt of all they keepe in their hands the goods of thoſe who haue credited them; and ſo ſeeke to riſe againe by their fall, &amp; to inrich themſelues by bringing others into pouertie: or if not ſo, then they ſeeke to buy or farme ſome office, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they may liue by bribing, proling, extortion and exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or procure a patent for ſome Monopolie, that ſo they may aduance and raiſe their owne gaines, out of the loſſe &amp; hinderance of the whole land and common wealth.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is, to moue men to liue within their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe, and to imbrace temperance and frugalitie as being <note place="margin">Frugalitie is a good vertue.</note> excellent vertues in themſelues, and alſo ſingular meanes to preſerue vs from many vices, and to reſtraine vs from ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into grieuous tentations: For ſo long as a man liuing by his honeſt labours, doth keepe his expences with in the compaſſe of his gaines ſo long he hath much peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and contentation of minde, neither is he eaſily drawn by hazarding his credit and much leſſe his ſoule, to gaine that wealth which he can well want; whereas thoſe who ſpend their time in idleneſſe pleaſure and luxurious exceſſe haue alwayes their mindes ſtretched vpon the racke of want, tormenting themſelues with carking care, how they may ſalue their credit, and maintaine their idle brauerie, and luxurious waſt; and not being able to compaſſe their deſires by honeſt and lawfull meanes, they lye open to all tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the diuell, and are ready to entertaine any wicked and diſhoneſt courſe which ſeemeth to proffer vnto them the leaſt gaine.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we may here obſerue, that the Lord condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <note place="margin">That it is an haynous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich our ſelues by the ſinnes of others.</note> it as a haynous offence, when as men deſire to inrich themſelues by the ſinnes of others; I ſay when as men deſire the falls of their neighbours for their owne aduantage: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is lawfull for Magiſtrates to take penall fines, when as they doe not deſire that their ſubiects ſhould offend for
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:10737:262"/> their owne gaine, but rather by theſe puniſhments indeauour to reſtraine them from committing of the like faults. But to delight in the ſins of our brethen, becauſe thereby we haue gaine and aduantage, is outragious wickedneſſe in the ſight of God; for ſeeing the plagues of God, death and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is the due wages belonging vnto ſinne, what do theſe men but greedely deſire gaine, though it coſt the price of mens bodyes and ſoules, and caſt the offenders downe into hell? Now if it be an outragious ſin to deſire gaines, though it be purchaſed with the bodily life of our neighbour, what ſhall we thinck of the horribleneſſe of their ſin, who ſeeke their owne profit by hazarding both their bodyes and ſoules to eternall deſtruction? Thus doth the Pope of Rome of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, who inricheth himſelfe by ſelling diſpenſations for ſinne, and is content to tollerate filthy ſtewes, that thereby he may increaſe his yearely revenew: And thus doe Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates offend, when they rejoyce in the peoples faults and tranſgresſions, becauſe by inflicting vpon them a penal mulct they inrich their owne coffers. Thus doe Lawyers offend, who delight in the malice, diſcord, and contentions of the people, becauſe hereby they haue fit opportunitie to inrich themſelues with fees. Thus doe Iudges and Officers of ſuch Courts offend, as make a pray of the ſinnes of the people, watching after &amp; hopefully expecting the neglect of duties, as after a booty or prize, and rejoycing in their hearts, when as they heare of adulteries, ſlanders, and other enormious crimes, becauſe they may out of them, raiſe their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, which wickedneſſe they manifeſtly commit, who change the courſe of the Law, and turne open puniſhments into priuie mulcts, and puniſhments which ſhould be perſonall and exemplary, into puniſhments of the purſe. Thus alſo do they ſinne, who that they may preuaile in their ſuites, giue hire vnto the ſons of Beliall to confirme their falſe euidence by wicked perjury. And thus doe ſhop-keepers grieuouſly offend, when as they can be content, that their ſeruants ſhould in ſelling their wares, vſe lying, ſwearing, and deceipt, that thereby they may put them off at the higher rate. But in this
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:10737:262"/> reſpect Miniſters doe moſt grieuouſly ſinne, when as either they miſlead the people, in errours and hereſies, that they may haue the fitter opportunitie of inriching themſelues; or when as they flatter them in their ſinnes, and ſow pillowes vnder their elbowes, that they may more ſecurely goe on in wickedneſſe, that ſo by pleaſing them in their lewde courſes, they may haue the greater intereſt in them, &amp; in their purſes. And this was the ſinne of the Prieſts in this place, who by their falſe doctrine hartned the people in their ſins, teaching them that when they had ſinned, there was no more to bee done, for the appeaſing of Gods anger, but to offer their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices: and thus the Scribes and Phariſes countenanced children in their vndutifullneſſe and rebellion againſt their parents, if they would bring vnto them oblations. Mat. 15. <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 4. 5.</note> 4. 5. 6. And this is the ſinne of thoſe falſe teachers which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> fore-telleth ſhould be in theſe latter dayes, which <hi>through couetouſneſſe ſhould with fained words make merchandiſe of mens ſoules.</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 3. The which prophecie <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 3.</note> we may ſee moſt euidently accompliſhed in the Cleargie of the Church of Rome, who for mony ſell diſpenſations for ſinnes, and incourage the people in all manner of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by offring vnto them eaſie remedies to free them from this burthen; namely, by doing or buying out of penance, by going on pilgimages, by offring to Saints, by purchaſing of pardons, indulgences, and abſolutions, by auricular confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by giuing of money to haue maſſes, trentals, and dirges ſaide for their ſoules: for what worldly man would not be incouraged to liue in his ſinnes, which are more deare vnto him then his wealth, yea, then the fruite of his owne body, as the Prophet ſheweth; if he may be acquitted of the guilt <note place="margin">Micah. 6. 7.</note> and puniſhments thereof by confeſsing them to the Prieſt, and by giuing of money for the procuring of a pardon or diſpenſation?</p>
               <p>The vſe of this doctrine ſerueth to make vs abhor the ſin <note place="margin">Couetouſneſſe the roote of all euill.</note> of couetouſnes, which if we once intertaine into our hearts, it wil lay them open vnto al wickednes; for as the Apoſtle ſaith, they who reſolue vpon this, that they <hi>will be rich, they fall into</hi>

                  <hi>Prieſt: for I will viſit their wayes vpon them, and reward them their deedes:</hi> or thus, <hi>therefore like as the people be, ſo ſhall the Prieſt bee alſo, &amp;c.</hi> In which words their puniſhment is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed <note place="margin">The expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> in a two-fold proportion of quantitie: firſt, that the people and Prieſts ſhould without any difference beare the like puniſhments. Secondly, that this retribution of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhould be proportionated to their wayes and works.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt, the Lord threatneth that becauſe there was no difference to be found betweene the people &amp; the Prieſts, but that both had vttterly neglected their duty: the Prieſts by liuing in ignorance, idleneſſe &amp; luxuriouſnes, neglecting the preaching of the word, whereby they ſhould haue inſtructed the people, and miſleading them by their falſe doctrine, into errors for their owne game &amp; aduantage: the people in that they willingly deſired to liue in ignorance, &amp; rather choſe to be vnder the leading of thoſe blind guides, becauſe they would ſecurely goe on in their ſinnes, then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gods true Prophets, who would gaule their conſciences by their reproofes: therefore without difference or reſpect of perſons, he would inflict vpon them like puniſhments, that is, hee would depriue both of all ſignes of his loue and fauour, cauſe both to be led into captiuitie, ſubject both to
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:10737:263"/> many miſeries and calamities, and make both alike contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible and inglorious.</p>
               <p>The which puniſhment as it did lye heauie vpon all the people in that they ſhould bee ſtripped of all the benefits which they injoyed, and ſubjected vnto want and miſerie, be made of free-men, bond-ſlaues, and of the children of God, the ſeruants of their enimies, ſo moſt heauily did it lye vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Prieſts, in that they fell as it were from the higheſt ſtaire of honour, riches, and dignitie, vnto as low a bottome of penurie, comtempt, and ignominie, as the meaneſt of the people. Where as there is any reſpect of perſons, in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, though the offence be one and the ſame, yet are the puniſhments diuers and different, for thoſe who are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and in high place, more faire and eaſie puniſhments; for thoſe of meane and baſe eſtate, thoſe which are more cruell and ignominious: but the Lord telleth the Prieſts here, that he would haue no regard of their place, but without all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſon or calling, would cauſe their puniſhment to be as ſharpe and ſhamefull as the baſeſt of the people. The like place vnto this we haue. Eſay. 24. 2. <hi>And there ſhall bee</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſay. 24. 2.</note>

               </p>
               <p>The reaſon why the Lord thus dealeth with them is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not Gods true Prieſts, but ſhadowes onely; which were in the place, but performed no ſubſtantiall duty of that calling, and bore the title, but vtterly neglected the maine part of their office, the teaching of the people. Now their function, honours, and titles, did not leſſen but rather aggrauated their ſinnes, in that they vnthankfully abuſed Gods extraordinarie benefites, and made their ſinnes more exemplarie and ſcandalous, in which reſpects it is truely ſayde.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>Omne animi vitium tantò conſpectius in ſe</l>

               <pb n="194" facs="tcp:10737:264"/>
               <p> And this was the firſt proportion of puniſhment, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that he would proportionate their puniſhments ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the haynouſnes of their offences. <hi>For I will viſite their wayes vpon them, and reward them their deeds.</hi> In which words is ſet downe both the adminiſtration of Gods judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the execution; the adminiſtration in theſe words; <hi>I will viſit their waies vpon them.</hi> For the vnderſtanding wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are to know, that the word viſit is metaphoricall, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the practiſe of juſt Magiſtrates who going about to puniſh offenders, doe firſt viſite and examine the faults, and then proceede to puniſhment: ſo the Lord to approue his righteous judgements, doth ſhew that hee will not inflict his puniſhments raſhly, but vpon mature delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and examination of the delinquents: the which the Lord is able to doe in an inſtant, both in reſpect of his owne infinite knowledge and wiſedome, and alſo in regard that he can alwayes readily produce our witneſſes againſt vs, euen our owne conſciences.</p>
               <p>The things which the Lord threatneth to viſit and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine are their wayes; the which alſo is metaphoricall, and ſignifieth a mans courſe of life &amp; conuerſation, in the which he walketh as in his conſtant way; and if at any time hee chance to digreſſe out of it, yet he returneth into it againe: And thus it is taken Gen. 6, 12. <hi>For all fleſh had corrupted his</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 6. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>way vpon the earth,</hi> &amp; Pſal. 1. 1. <hi>Nor ſtood in the way of ſinners.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 1. 2.</note> So that he will not examine and puniſh them according to their extraordinarie actions, which are as it were ſlips out of the way, by-pathes and digerſsions, but according to their vſuall wayes, that is, the conſtant and continued courſe of their life and conuerſation.</p>
               <p>The execution of Gods juſt judgements, after due triall and examination, is expreſſed in theſe words: <hi>and reward them their deeds.</hi> Where the Lord threatneth that hee will deale with them as a juſt judge, neither rigorouſly intending the puniſhment aboue the fault, nor partially ſparing them for fauour or friendſhip, but that he will equally proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the puniſhments according to their demerits. Where
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:10737:264"/> we may note that he doth not ſay, he will reward them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their thoughts and intentions, nor according to their words and ſpeeches, becauſe the one of theſe is hidden from men, and the other may be hipocritically coloured and diſſembled, but that hee may approue his righteous judgements both to the offender and to all others, hee ſaith hee will reward them according to their deeds, which are open and manifeſt.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of the words: the doctrines <note place="margin">The doctrines, Gods vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> which ariſe out of them are theſe. Firſt, wee may obſerue Gods vpright and vnpartiall proceeding in the adminiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and execution of his judgements and puniſhments, whereby without any reſpect or acceptation of perſons, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, or degree, he rendreth vnto euerie one according to their deſerts, as in this place, howſoeuer the Prieſts farre excelled the common people, in place, dignitie, and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, yet becauſe they were a like ſinfull, he putteth no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between them in their puniſhments. When the whole world rebelled againſt him, without any reſpect of perſons, ſtate, or condition, he ouer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>whelmed them all with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall deluge. When <hi>Pharaoh</hi> reſiſted his commaundement, he found no more fauour then the baſeſt of his people. When <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> would needs be his riuall in his glorie, it was not his Monarchie could keepe him from feeding and lodging amongſt the brute beaſts. All <hi>Ahabs</hi> royalty po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and authoritie, could not priuiledge neither him nor <hi>Ieſabell</hi> from hauing their blood licked by the dogges. In a word there was neuer any ſo great and mightie who had any fauour at Gods hand for their power and mightineſſe, but if they as grieuouſly ſinned, they alſo were as grieuouſly puniſhed, as the pooreſt and moſt abject. The curſe of the law is denounced indifferently againſt all who tranſgreſſe it, Deut. 27. 26. <hi>Tophet is prepared of old,</hi> not onely for poore <note place="margin">Deut. 27. 26. Eſay 30. 33. Ezech. 18. 20.</note> wicked men but alſo <hi>for the wicked King,</hi> Eſay. 30. 33. And without all reſpect of perſons <hi>the ſoule that ſinneth muſt dye.</hi> Ezech. 18. 20. The reaſon is becauſe they are all alike the workmanſhip of his hands; and therefore as the potter is no
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:10737:265"/> more beholding to his pots which are more curiouſlie wrought, then to thoſe which are made for the baſeſt vſe; ſo the Lord is no more bound to men of greateſt dignitie, then to thoſe of meaneſt condition, ſeeing all are his creatures, alike, and what they haue, they haue receiued from him. This reaſon <hi>Elihu</hi> rendreth, <hi>he accepteth not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the perſon of Princes, and regardeth not the rich more then the poore, for they be all the worke of his hands. Iob.</hi> 34. 19. Againe, in reſpect <note place="margin">Iob. 34. 19.</note> of Gods infinte Majeſtie all are alike, and in reſpect of his ſoueraigne authoritie, all are equally his poore vaſſals, vnto whom he hath giuen his Law, from the obedience whereof none are exempted more then other, nor yet from the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment therein denounced if they tranſgreſſe it. Yea, ſo far is God from ſparing the great, rich, and mighty, that theſe of all other ſhall receiue the greateſt meaſure of puniſhment. Firſt, becauſe they haue more vnthankfully abuſed his rich mercies as meanes to further them in their ſins, which ſhould haue ſerued as ſo many arguments to moue them to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, &amp; then becauſe being aduanced aboue others in place, dignitie and authoritie, their ſinnes tend more to the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and hurt of their neighbours, then the ſinnes of thoſe who are in meane eſtate, becauſe they are examplary and ſcandalous, inticing and drawing inferiours to imitate their wicked practiſes; ſo that ſeldome do theſe high Cedars fall, but they beate downe many of the lower ſhrubs that ſtand about them.</p>
               <p>The vſes of this doctrine eyther concerne all men in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, <note place="margin">Gods vpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſhould moue vs to mortifie our ſinnes.</note> or more eſpecially reſpect thoſe who are of higher place and condition: the vſe which concernes all men is, firſt, that ſeeing the Lord who is to be their judge, judgeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly without reſpect of perſons, they be hereby moued to labour in the mortifying of their corruptions, in the &amp; clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of their ſoules from ſin, that ſo they may appeare righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before him, and thereby eſcape the ſeueritie of his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. And this vſe <hi>Moſes</hi> maketh, Deut. 10. 16. <hi>Circumciſe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Deu. 10. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>therefore the foreskinne of your hearts, and harden your necks no more.</hi> 17. <hi>For the Lord your God, is God of Gods, and Lord of</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:10737:265"/> 
                  <hi>Lords, a great God, mighty and terrible, which accepteth no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, nor taketh reward.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond vſe is, that wee ſhake off ſecuritie, whereby <note place="margin">Gods juſtice ſhould make vs to ſhake off ſecurity.</note> men careleſly goe forward in their ſinnes, as though God would neuer call them to reckoning, or though he did, yet were ſo mercifull that no place will be left for his juſtice; ſuch are to know, that as God is infinite in mercy, ſo alſo hee is infinite in juſtice, and therefore will execute his righteous judgements, according to their workes good or euill, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect of any mans perſon: ſo that it behoueth euery one carefully to watch ouer their owne wayes, and to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with feare before Gods majeſtie, when as they finde that they liue in any knowne ſinne without repentance. And this vſe is made by the Apoſtle. 1 Pet. 1. 17. <hi>And if ye call him</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>father, which without reſpect of perſons iudgeth according to euerie mans worke, paſſe the time of your dwelling here in feare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third generall vſe is, that we doe not offer wrongs <note place="margin">God a juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenger of wrongs.</note> and injuries againſt our neighbours, for though we can carry the matter ſo cunningly that they can get no aduantage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs before the judgement ſeate of men, yet when God the vpright Iudge ſhall come in his viſitation, he will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect of perſon reuenge the wrongs of the injured, and pay euery one by that meaſure wherewith they haue meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto others. And this vſe alſo the Apoſtle maketh, diſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding men from behauing themſelues injuriouſly to others, becauſe <hi>hee that doth wrong ſhall receiue for the wrong which hee hath done, there being no reſpect of perſons with GOD.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Col. 3. 25.</note> Col. 3. 25.</p>
               <p>The vſe which concerneth Superiours: firſt, reſpecteth <note place="margin">God puniſheth the mighty as well as the weake.</note> thoſe who excell others in power and riches, that they bee not hereby enbouldened to bee inſolent in offring injuryes, or cruell in oppreſsing the poore and weake, knowing that there is a ſuperiour power vnto theirs, who nought reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their wealth and might, for hee regardeth not bribes, nor feareth the face of the Prince, more then the baſeſt ſubject, who one day will goe his circuit and viſitation, and ſummon
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:10737:266"/> all to appeare at his Aſsiſes, and will haue the cauſes of the weake and needy, without partialitie tryed before him: <hi>For hee accepteth not the perſons of Princes, and regardeth not the rich more then the poore, becauſe they be all alike the work of his hands,</hi> as it is Iob. 34. 19. <note place="margin">Iob. 34. 19.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it reſpecteth ſuperiours in authoritie, as Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, <note place="margin">Magiſtrates muſt execute righteous judgement.</note> and maiſters of families, that they be hereby moued not to abuſe their authoritie which God hath put into their hands, to his diſhonour and the hurt of their neighbour. As firſt, that the Magiſtrates in the feare of the Lord execute righteous judgement, without hauing reſpect of any mans perſon, place, or ſtate, not peruerting juſtice for feare, fauour, or reward; knowing that there is a ſupreame Magiſtate aboue them, before whom they muſt be alſo judged, who cannot be corrupted or peruerted, from judging righteouſly, becauſe <hi>there is no iniquitie with him, nor reſpect of perſons, nor receiuing of rewards,</hi> as <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> ſpeaketh to his Iudges. 2 Chron. <note place="margin">1 Chron. 19. 6. 7.</note> 19. 6. 7. So likewiſe Maiſters of families, are ſo to behaue themſelues towards their familie and ſeruants, in loue, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſſe and juſtice, as knowing that they alſo haue a mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in heauen, and a judge of all their actions, who will judge without all partialitie, the perſon of the Maiſter and ſeruant, being vnto him both alike; and this vſe the Apoſtle maketh of this doctrine. Eph. 6. 9. <note place="margin">Ephe. 6. 9.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to bee conſidered is, that howſoeuer <note place="margin">God doth not continually pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh our ſins, but deferreth his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine dayes of viſitation.</note> wicked men doe daily by their ſinnes prouoke Gods wrath, yet the Lord doth not continually inflict his puniſhments, but as a juſt and mercifull Iudge, deferreth them vnto cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine times of viſitation, and as it were vnto certaine dayes of Aſsiſes, as appeareth in this place; for howſoeuer the Prieſts were ſo wholy corrupted in their wayes, that they deſerued preſent puniſhment, yet he doth not preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict it, but deferreth it to the day of his viſitation: ſo when the whole world was wholy corrupted with ſinne, yet he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred their puniſhment for the ſpace of an hundred yeares. Though Sodome and Gomorrah abounded in all wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet he put off the day of his viſitation till the meaſure
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:10737:266"/> of their ſinnes was full: and though the Cananites were out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly ſinfull, yet the Lord deferred to puniſh them for many yeares, till their ſinnes were come to full ripeneſſe. The cauſes of which delayes are diuers: the firſt and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall is Gods owne nature, euen his patience and long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, which maketh him long in reſoluing to puniſh, and when he hath reſolued, ſlow in execution: and this the Lord himſelfe profeſſeth in that diſcription whereby hee maketh himſelfe knowne. Exod. 34. 6. <hi>The Lord, the Lord, ſtrong,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 34. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>mercifull and gracious, ſlow to anger.</hi> So <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſal. 103. 8. <note place="margin">Pſal. 103. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord is full of compaſſion and mercy, ſlow to anger and of great kindneſſe.</hi> 9. <hi>He will not alway chide, &amp;c.</hi> And this made <hi>Ionah</hi> lothe to denounce deſtruction againſt Nineueh <hi>becauſe he knew that he was a gracious God and mercifull, ſlow to anger, repenting him of euill.</hi> As it is Ion. 4. 2. The ſecond cauſe is, <note place="margin">Ion. 4. 2.</note> that men may haue time to turne from their ſinnes by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and ſo eſcape his puniſhments. For God taketh no delight in their deſtruction, but in their conuerſion and ſaluation, as hee proteſteth. Ezech. 33. 11. And this end <note place="margin">Ezech. 33. 11.</note> the Lord plainely noteth, Eſa. 30. 18. <hi>Yet therefore will the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſa. 30. 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord waite that he may haue mercy vpon you, &amp;c.</hi> And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle plainly expreſſeth it. Rom. 2. 4. where he ſaith, that <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Gods patience and long-ſuffering leadeth vs to repentance.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> likewiſe, whereas he ſaith, that <hi>the Lord is pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent towards vs, becauſe he would haue no man to periſh, but would haue all men to come to repentance.</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 9. Laſtly, that he <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 9.</note> may leaue the wicked and impenitent without excuſe; for when as he hath ſhewed himſelfe lothe to puniſh both by his delayes, and by vſing all meanes to reclaime them, and yet they ſtubbornly perſiſt in their wickedneſſe, then are the judgements of God inflicted vpon them approued by all men, and euen by their owne guilty conſciences.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding howſoeuer the Lord for theſe and diuers <note place="margin">Gods delaying judgement ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth men ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure.</note> other cauſes deferreth the execution of his juſt vengeance, yet men abuſe this his long-ſuffering vnto ſin, either imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the Atheiſt, that he hath not thunderbolts inough to dart againſt euery ſinner for euery fault, or that there is
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:10737:267"/> no prouidence, no juſtice, no God that regardeth the ſins of men: or with the ſecure Worldling, that they may go on in their ſinnes without repentance, becauſe theſe puniſhments which are ſo long delayed, will neuer be inflicted; according to that, Eccle. 8. 11. <hi>becauſe ſentence againſt an euill worke is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccl. 8. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>not executed ſpeedely, therefore the hart of the children of men is fully ſet in them to doe euill.</hi> An example whereof we haue in the euill ſeruant. Mat. 24. 48. who becauſe his maiſter <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 48.</note> deferred his comming, ſo behaued himſelfe as though hee would neuer come: and in thoſe mockers who becauſe the day of judgement is deferred, therefore walk after their owne <note place="margin">2 Pet. 4. 3.</note> luſts; like herein vnto fooliſh theeues, who imagine that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Iudge doth not euery day ſit vpon the judgement ſeat, therefore they may ſecurely ſteale, becauſe the Aſsiſes will neuer come.</p>
               <p>But ſuch are to know, that as Gods mercy and patience will not ſuffer him to make haſt in the puniſhing of ſinne, ſo his juſtice will not ſuffer him for euer to let it go vnpuniſhed; and howſoeuer hee doth not vſe martiall law in executing juſtice as ſoone as the offence is committed, yet let them aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure themſelues, that vnleſſe by repentance they plead their pardon, he will ſurely viſite them, either at his quarter Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in this life, or at his generall Aſsiſes in the life to come. Though <hi>Saul</hi> were long repriued, after he was condemned, yet at laſt came the fearefull day of his execution. Though <hi>Naboths</hi> bloud was long vnreuenged, yet at laſt God viſited this ſinne, both vpon <hi>Ahab, Ieſabell</hi> and all their poſterity. Though for a time <hi>Ieroboam</hi> flouriſhed in his Idolatry, yet at length it brought a fearefull deſtruction vpon his whole familie. And though the Lord for a long while ſuffered the people of the Iewes with great patience and long-ſuffering, yet at laſt he payed them home, ſo that now they are a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of his heauy wrath vnto all nations, and a reproach and hiſsing to the whole world.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this doctrine is, firſt, for our inſtruction, that we imitate the Lord in his patience and long long-ſuffering, not letting the raines looſe to fury and reuenge, vpon euery
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:10737:267"/> occaſion, but rather ſtriuing to ouercome euill with good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for our admonition, that we doe not abuſe Gods patience to impenitencie and hardneſſe of hart, leaſt whilſt we thus heape vp the meaſure of our ſinnes, we doe alſo <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure vp for our ſelues wrath againſt the day of wrath, and of the declaration of the iuſt iudgement of God, who will reward euery man according to his workes,</hi> as it is, Rom. 2. 5. 6. <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 5. 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing to be obſerued is, that he ſaith he will viſit their wayes vpon them; thereby giuing them to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, <note place="margin">God judgeth vs according to our vſuall conuerſation, and not our extraordinarie actions.</note> that hee would not in examining and judging of them ſtand vpon their errours, by-pathes, and extraordinary acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but vpon their vſuall behauiour, and vpon their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie courſe in their life and conuerſation. From whence we learne that the Lord in the day of his viſitation will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard nor examine our ſinnes to puniſh them, nor our good actions to reward them, if they be extraordinarie and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uagant, but will deale with vs according to our cuſtomable carriage of our ſelues, and vſuall demeanure: ſo that if our way and courſe of life wherein we walke, be the way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyneſſe and righteouſneſſe he juſtifieth and approueth of vs, notwithſtanding our many ſlips and fals in this way, and er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, by-pathes, and digreſsions out of this way: for not onely they are to be accounted bleſſed of God, who ſinne not, ſeing thus the bleſsing ſhould belong to none of the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> Chriſt excepted, but they alſo are bleſſed <hi>Who haue not ſtood in the way of ſinners, nor ſate in the ſeate of the ſcorners,</hi> as it is, Pſal. 1. 1. that is, who haue not made <note place="margin">Pſal. 1. 1.</note> a cuſtome and vſuall practiſe of ſinne and wickedneſſe; and the reaſon is, becauſe the Lord doth not judge vs as he find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs in ſome by-way, where into we haue bene thruſt with ſome violent or ſuddaine paſsion, but according to that way wherein we walke with a conſtant purpoſe and ſetled reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. So it is ſaide that they are bleſſed, who are vpright in their way, and walke in the Law of the Lord, Pſal. 119 1. <note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 1.</note> that is, they are bleſſed notwithſtanding all their infirmities and imperfections, who in the vprightneſſe of their harts
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:10737:268"/> deſire to keepe a conſtant courſe in godlyneſſe; and howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they often goe aſtray through errour and corruption, yet make choiſe of Gods Law as the way wherein they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to walke. For if the <hi>Lord ſhould marke what is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, who were able to abide it?</hi> Pſal. 130. 3. If hee ſhould <hi>Enter into iudgement with vs,</hi> and examine our particular <note place="margin">Pſal. 130. 3.</note> faults, <hi>none that liueth ſhould be iuſtified in his ſight.</hi> Pſ. 143. 2. <note place="margin">Pſal. 143. 2.</note> But the Lord knoweth our weakneſſe, and accepteth of our deſire and indeauours, <hi>he doth not deale with vs after our ſins, nor rewards vs after our iniquities: but as a father hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion on his children, ſo hath the Lord compaſſion on them that feare him: for he knoweth whereof we be made, he remembreh that wee are but duſt,</hi> as it is Pſal. 103. 10. 13. 14. <note place="margin">Pſal. 103. 10. 13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>As therefore a louing father beareth with the infirmities of his childe, when he ſeeth that he taketh good courſes, &amp; indeauoureth with an earneſt deſire to pleaſe him: ſo the <note place="margin">God pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities when we haue good indeauours.</note> Lord much more accepteth of the imperfect obedience of his children, when as he ſeeth that with vpright harts, they deſire to ſerue and pleaſe him, couering their imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with Chriſts perfect righteouſneſſe, and waſhing away their corruptions in his moſt precious blood, ſo as in the day of judgement they ſhall not ariſe againſt them to their condemnation. Although <hi>Dauid</hi> did make a fearefull digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion out of the way of righteouſneſſe when as he commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted murther and adulterie, and numbred the people, yet God did not judge him according to theſe particular ſlips, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the whole courſe of his life he kept the wayes of the Lord, and hated all by-wayes of falſhood and iniquitie, as himſelfe profeſſeth, Pſal. 18. 21. and 119. 104. Hee did not condemne <hi>Peter</hi> for digresſing into the way of iniquitie <note place="margin">Pſal. 18. 2. and 119. 104.</note> when as he denied his maiſter, becauſe he did not voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make choiſe of this way, but was ſuddainely thruſt into it by violent feare; nor <hi>Paul</hi> becauſe he ſometimes did the euill <note place="margin">Mat. 26.</note> which he would not, being taken captiue with the violence of ſinne, ſeeing he was in his generall courſe delighted in the <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> law of God, and did earneſtly ſtriue againſt his corruptions.</p>
               <p>So in like manner, he judgeth the wicked according to
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:10737:268"/> their wayes, and not according to their particular actions, <note place="margin">God reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not ague fits in religion.</note> neither doth hee reſpect their ague fits of Religion, and juſtice, when as generally in the courſe of their life, they caſt his lawes behind their backe, and willingly walke in the wayes of wickedneſſe, but judgeth them according to their wayes, and the conſtant courſe of their conuerſation. So it is ſaide that the <hi>wicked ſhould eate the fruite of their owne wayes.</hi> Prou. 1. 31. And the Lord threatneth to viſit <hi>Iacob</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 1. 31.</note> according to his wayes, Hoſ. 12. 2. Though <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <note place="margin">Hoſ. 12. 2.</note> confeſſed his ſinne and juſtified God; though <hi>Saul</hi> vttered many good ſpeeches, and performed many actions which might well haue beſeemed a better man; though <hi>Iehu</hi> in a fit ſhewed great zeale in ſuppreſsing idolatrie, and in erecting Gods true worſhip; though <hi>Ahab</hi> once humbled himſelfe before God, and by outward ſignes teſtified his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; and though <hi>Herod</hi> hard <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt willingly, and in many things yeelded obedience to his admonitions, yet none of all theſe were approued by God, becauſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer their particular actions were, yet they were wicked in their wayes, that is, in their life and conuerſation.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this doctrine is, that wee labour for vpright <note place="margin">We muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right harts.</note> harts, and conſtantly reſolue to forſake all ſinne, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace all righteouſneſſe in our liues and conuerſations; and then if beſides our purpoſe and deſire we digreſſe out of the right way by falling into ſome ſinne through infirmitie and the violence of our corruptions, the Lord will ſpare vs as a father ſpareth his childe, who deſireth to pleaſe him, as hee profeſſeth, Mal. 3. 17. Neither ſhall our imperfections and <note place="margin">Mal. 3. 17.</note> ſlips, with-draw Gods loue or hinder our ſaluation, becauſe he doth not viſite nor puniſh men, according to their errours and ſlips, but according to their wayes, and ordinarie courſe of life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſerueth for the terrour of hipocrites, who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely <note place="margin">God regardeth not the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uagant good deeds of hipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crits.</note> goe on in the courſe of ſinne, thinking that God will be well pleaſed if at ſometimes they make a ſhew of religion by going to the Church, or giuing an almes to a poore man, or by performing ſome other workes of juſtice, mercy,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:10737:269"/> or liberalitie. But ſuch are to know, that vnleſſe they keepe a conſtant courſe in godlines, and make the path of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and holineſſe their ordinary way, all their particular good workes, which are but as it were ſo many ſteppings aſide out of their conſtant courſe of ſinning, will little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit them in the day of Gods viſitation, becauſe they ſhall bee judged, not according to their extrauagant good deedes, but according to their wayes and ordinary conuerſation.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing to be obſerued is, that he ſaith he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <note place="margin">God judgeth vs according to our outward actions.</note> them according to their deeds Whence we learne that in the execution of Gods puniſhments and judgements, he doth not proceed according to mens thoughts and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, nor yet according to their ſpeaches and words, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their workes and actions; ſo that it will not auaile vs, when God commeth to viſite and judge vs, to ſay that we haue had many godly reſolutions, religious intentions, and a good meaning; nor yet that we haue ſaid, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> and made a goodly profeſsion of religion and godlineſſe, if we haue beene profane and vnjuſt in life and conuerſation, and <hi>haue not done the will of our father which is in heauen.</hi> Mat. <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 21.</note> 7. 21. Seeing the Lord will reward vs, not according to our thoughts and words, but according to our deeds and works. Not that the Lord will in judgement neglect the thoughts and words of the godly to reward them, and of the wicked to puniſh them; for <hi>the Lord ſeeth all things.</hi> Iob. 42. 2. <hi>He</hi>

Mat. 25. 35. 42. From whence we are not <note place="margin">Mat. 25. 35. 42</note> to gather with the Papiſts, that as wicked men are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for the demerit of their euill workes, ſo the godly are ſaued for the merit of their good works; ſeeing there is not the like reaſon in that they are abſolutely euill, but theſe not abſolutely good and perfect, and therefore cannot juſtifie nor ſaue vs before Gods judgement ſeate, they being imperfect; but onely a liuely faith, which doth apply vnto vs Chriſts perfect righteouſneſſe. But for as much as this faith is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall grace, and not outwardly ſeene, therefore the Lord to take away the brags of hypocrites, who would boaſt of that faith which indeede they haue not, and to approue vnto all his righteous judgements in diſpenſing of his rewards and puniſhments, doth not judge according to the roote of faith which is hidden, but according to the fruits of good works which are open and manifeſt.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this doctrine is, that we do not with ignorant <note place="margin">We muſt not content our ſelues with our good meanings</note> people content our ſelues with our good meanings, nor with hypocrites reſt in glorious ſpeaches and in a goodly profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Religion, but that wee labour to approue both our good intentions and outward profeſsion to be indeed ſincere and vpright, by our holy practiſe and actuall obedience. For <hi>not euery one who ſaith Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the kingdome of heauen, but he that doth the will of the father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi> Mat. 7. 21. <hi>Not the hearers of the Law, but the doers</hi>

                  <hi>commit Adulterie and ſhall not increaſe, becauſe they haue left off to take heede to the Lord.</hi> In which words he doth propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate <note place="margin">The expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> a puniſhment to their ſinne, and withall adjoyneth another cauſe of all the euill which he brought vpon them. The puniſhment proportionable to their ſin is, that whereas they bent their whole indeauour to pamper the belly, and to paſſe their dayes in all voluptuous exceſſe, the Lord threatneth that they ſhould ſpend all their labour in vaine, for eyther they ſhould not attaine to that plenty which they ſo earneſtly deſired, or though they had abundance, yet he would with-draw his bleſsing and make all vnprofitable, ſo as they ſhould finde no contentment in any thing which they injoyed: and whereas they exceedingly deſired to haue ſtore of children, vnto whom they might leaue that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant wealth which they had couetouſly ſcraped by the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked abuſe of their office and Prieſt-hood, that ſo they might perpetuate their names and continue an euerlaſting memory of themſelues in their poſteritie; and becauſe they could not haue ſo many children as they deſired in lawfull marriage, therefore gaue themſelues to vnlawfull luſts, and multiplyed their adulteries, that ſo at leaſt they might increaſe a baſtardly broode, who might ſucceed them; the Lord threatneth that he would croſſe them in this their wicked purpoſe alſo; for howſoeuer they multipled their whoredomes for increaſe, yet their poſteritie ſhould not hereby bee multiplyed, but their name ſhould periſh notwithſtanding all their wicked deuices to continue it, and their wealth which they deſired ſhould be injoyed by their children, ſhould all come into
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:10737:270"/> the hands of ſtrangers.</p>
               <p>The meaning then of theſe words is this, that becauſe theſe Prieſts cared not what wicked meanes they vſed ſo they might accompliſh their deſires, therefore the Lord threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to croſſe and curſe them in all their impious deſignes, ſo as they ſhould by no meanes attaine vnto their euill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. More particularly, becauſe they were addicted vnto all manner of wicked auarice, that being inriched they might ſpend their time in voluptuous pleaſures, he therefore threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that though they had ſtore of foode, yet it ſhould not ſatisfie them; though they exceeded in all manner of volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous pleaſures, yet they ſhould bring vnto them no manner of contentment, but the more they fed vpon them, the more they ſhould hunger after them; and howſoeuer they ſeemed filled, yea and cloyed with them, yet they ſhould not ſatisfie them, but rather increaſe their appetite. And becauſe for the increaſing of their poſterity, they rather truſted to their adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, then to Gods bleſsing on their lawfull marriage, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he threatneth that they ſhould ſpend their ſtrength in vaine, and notwithſtanding all their wicked indeauours to the contrary, ſhould dye childeleſſe.</p>
               <p>The cauſe and as it is were the roote of all theſe euils, is diſcouered in theſe words: <hi>Becauſe they haue left off to take heede to the Lord:</hi> or, <hi>to obſerue and waite vpon the Lord.</hi> Which words may admit of a generall or more ſpeciall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation: generally they may be vnderſtood thus, that therefore theſe euils came vpon them, becauſe they had giuen ouer to obſerue the Lord, his will, and his commandements, that they might performe obedience vnto them; for ſeruants are ſaide to obſerue their maiſters when as they diligently waite vpon them, and are ready at their becke, marking and obſeruing both out of their words and countenances, what is their will and pleaſure, that they may obey it. And thus this phraſe is vſed Zach. 11. 11. <hi>The poore of the ſheepe which doe</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Zach. 11. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>obſerue me, or waite vpon mee,</hi> that is, who indeauour to ſerue and pleaſe mee. So that in this ſenſe the ſinne which is here laid to their charge was, that they had giuen ouer to ſerue the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:10737:271"/> Lord, and had forſaken his pure worſhip preſcribed in his word, and not marking what Gods will was, had giuen ouer themſelues to will-worſhip, and the inuentions of their owne braine.</p>
               <p>The more ſpeciall interpretation, which I take to be moſt fit and agreeable to the text is this; that becauſe they had vſed all wicked &amp; vngodly meanes, to maintaine themſelues in voluptuous pleaſures, to attaine vnto riches, and to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate their poſteritie, and had left off to obſerue the Lord, that is, to wait vpon him, in the vſe of lawfull meanes, for the attaining vnto their deſires, not regarding what was his will, ſo they might haue their owne wil, nor relying vpon his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, but vpon their owne vnlawfull ſhifts; therefore he would croſſe them in their wicked courſes, and would ſo curſe their vngodly meanes vnto them, becauſe they would not relye themſelues vpon his bleſsing, in the vſe of thoſe which were good, that they ſhould periſh in their fruſtrated hopes, and altogether faile in their deſires.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of the words; the doctrines which <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The doctrines </seg>
                  </label> ariſe out of them are diuers. Firſt, we may generally obſerue, <note place="margin">God croſſeth the purpoſes &amp; plots of wicked worldlings.</note> that howſoeuer the wicked &amp; vngodly do make ſure account by their ſubtill plots and miſchieuous practiſes to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh their deſires, and to compaſſe what they will, yet the Lord ſo croſſeth them in their euill courſes, that they faile in their hopes, and are altogether diſappointed in their deſignes; for either the Lord doth meerely fruſtrate all their labour, in not ſuffering them to attaine vnto ſuch worldly benefits, which they purſue, or if they obtaine them, yet doth not ſuffer them to injoy them, becauſe he with-holdeth his bleſsing, and all comfort and contentment in the vſe of them. For the firſt: how many are there who haue ſet their harts wholy vpon the world, and with far more feruent deſire haue ſought for temporall benefits, then the ſaluation of their own ſoules, not caring what wicked meanes they vſed, ſo they might accompliſh their deſignes, and yet haue beene ſo croſſed by God, that they could neuer atchiue their wils? How many ambitious men haue ſpent their whole liues in
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:10737:271"/> climing the hill of honour, ſometimes labouring to aduance themſelues by Machiuilian pollicies; ſometimes indeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to clime vp by treading vpon other mens ſhoulders, not caring who fall ſo they may riſe, and yet could neuer make any aſcent at all, or if they did, haue tumbled downe againe before they haue come to the mid way, into the loweſt bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of ſhame and diſgrace? Whilſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſought to be in honour equall to God himſelfe, he got a ſhamefull downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall and if Gods mercy had not ſtayed him by the way, hee had fallen as deepe into hell as the Diuell. The old world laboured to get fame by raiſing a Tower vp to heauen; but the end was Babel, that is, confuſion. <hi>Abſolon</hi> deſired to ſeat himſelfe vpon the royall throne, but the aduancement which hee got, was to bee hanged on a Tree. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> would be honoured as a God, but he was abaſed vnder the condition of the meaneſt man, and became a companion of the beaſts. So how many couetous men haue ſpent their time in greedy ſcraping of riches, who in ſcraping haue ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them, and whileſt (like <hi>Eſops</hi> Dog) they greedely graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped after that which they had not, loſt that they had? How many is there who in ſeeking wealth, haue found pouerty, prouing that true in their owne experience (which the wiſe <note place="margin">Prou. 23. 5.</note> man ſpeaketh) that riches taketh her to her wings as an Eagle, and fleeth away the faſter, the more eagerly ſhee is purſued? ſo how many haue fixed their mindes wholy vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on voluptuous pleaſures, who by ſurfetting, drunkenneſſe, and vnlawfull luſts, haue drawne vpon themſelues grieuous ſickneſſes and diſeaſes, and haue ended their dayes in griefe and miſery?</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof ſerueth to ſhew, the wretched eſtate of <note place="margin">The wretched eſtate of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked worldlings</note> wicked worldlings, who miſerably toyle themſelues in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing theſe tranſitorie trifles, and yet in the end doe miſſe of their purpoſe and looſe all their labour; yea and that which is worſt of all, after they haue made ſale of their ſoules, by vſing all wicked meanes for the purchaſing of theſe worldly vanities, they are mocked in their hopes, and whileſt they put out their hand to receiue their miſerable bargaine,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:10737:272"/> and open the bag to ſee what they haue gained, they finde in ſtead of honour ſhame, for riches pouerty, and for pleaſures griefe and miſerie. Herein not vnlike to vnhappy vnthrifts, who hauing ſould their goodly patrimonies for a meales meate, after they haue paſſed from them all their title and intreſt, be ſent away empty without any reliefe.</p>
               <p>And this is the ſtate of ſuch wretched men, who vſing all wicked meanes for the compaſsing of their deſires, doe after <note place="margin">Wicked men haue no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in worldly benefits.</note> much hunting catch nothing: neither is the caſe of thoſe much better who by vnlawfull courſes haue gotten the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion of that which ſo eagerly they purſued; for though they haue it, yet they injoy it not, though they abound in all worldly things, yet they haue no benefit by them, the Lord not giuing them hearts to vſe them to their comforts and contentation. For how many are there who whileſt they are purſuing theſe tranſitorie trifles doe highly eſteeme of them, imagining that they ſhould attaine vnto a high degree of happineſſe, if they might attaine them, but after that they haue once poſſeſsion of them, can finde in their vſe no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or contentation, either becauſe they finde them far ſhort of their expectation, or becauſe they haue in them as much trouble and vexation, as pleaſure and benefit, or finally in that they haue wounded their conſciences by vſing wicked meanes in comming by them.</p>
               <p>Others there are, whom the Lord giueth ouer to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented <note place="margin">The deſires of worldlings are in ſatiable.</note> with the hungrie furie of vnſatiableneſſe, whereby it commeth to paſſe that all which they get of theſe world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanities, ſerueth but as fuell to increaſe the flames of their luſts, as drinke to their dropſie deſires which nouriſh the diſeaſe but doe not quench their thirſt, as ſawces which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſharpen the appetite then allay their hunger, and as winde in the ſtomacke which filling ſatisfieth not but rather tormenteth: the ambitious man can neuer be ſatisfied with honour, but is more tormented when he ſeeth but one aboue him, then delighted when he ſeeth thouſands vnder him, &amp; is more vexed with one ſuppoſed diſgrace, then contented with innumerable honours which are done vnto him, as
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:10737:272"/> appeareth in the example of <hi>Haman</hi> who was euen ſick with <note place="margin">Eſter. 5. 12. 13.</note> griefe and deſpight when onely <hi>Mordecay</hi> neglected him, though all the reſt of the emperours court did him obeiſance.</p>
               <p>So the couetous man is neuer ſatisfied with riches; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Eccle. 5. 9. <hi>Hee that loueth ſiluer ſhall neuer be</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 5. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>ſatisfied with ſiluer, and hee that loueth riches ſhall be without the fruit thereof.</hi> Where he ſetteth downe a two-fould quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a couetous man; the firſt is that he is inſatiable; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is commeth to paſſe that the more he hath the more hee deſireth, <hi>et cum habet quod voluit, non habet quod vult,</hi> when hee hath what hee deſired hee reſteth not ſatisfied, but ſtill deſireth more; and though hee hath too much yet hee hath neuer inough, though vnto others he ſeemeth to abound, yet in his owne judgement hee is ſtill in want. In which reſpect <note place="margin">Pro. 27. 20. &amp; 30 15.</note> Couetouſnes is compared to a bottomles gulfe, or the graue, which are neuer filled, and to horſe-leaches, which are ſtill ſucking but are neuer ſatisfied. The other is his miſery, in that hee depriueth himſelfe of the fruition of that which hee poſſeſſeth; for ſo wholie intentiue is hee in hunting after a new pray, that he pineth with hunger, forgetting to feed vpon that which he hath already caught<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo eager in purſuing that wealth which he hath not, that he quite forgetteth to vſe that he hath, and therefore it is truely ſaide, that <hi>auarus eget tam quae habet, quam quae non habet,</hi> he hath no more vſe of that which he hath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then of that which he hath not; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of which his miſerable condition, the wiſe man prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vntimely birth before ſuch a life.

               </p>
               <p>So likewiſe the voluptuous man feedeth continually vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pleaſures but is neuer ſatisfied with them, for when hee hath inioyed one, he hungreth after another, and when hee hath injoyed thouſands, he is as farre from contentment as at the beginning; ſo that pleaſures to the voluptuous are like vnto ſweet drinks; they are delightfull in the going downe but neuer quench the thirſt.

               <p>The vſe of this doctrine is, that we doe affect theſe world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Worldly things muſt be affected moderately,</note> things with great moderation, and that we vſe onely thoſe meanes which are lawfull for the accompliſhing of our

And when to obtaine them wee haue taken a certaine courſe to disinherite our ſelues of heauen, and to enter into ſure poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsion of hell, this heauie but juſt judgement ſhall be added vnto all the reſt, that wee ſhall be giuen ouer to be tormented with the <hi>Canina appetentia,</hi> the greedy worme, ſo as wee ſhall ſtill be feeding vpon theſe earthly vanities but ſhall neuer be ſatisfied, and they ſhall be vnto vs as painted meates, which may for a time pleaſe the eye, but will rather increaſe our appetite, then allay our hunger.</p>
               <p>The vſe is, that wee ſet our hearts vpon the Lord, and in the firſt place ſeeke heauenly things; for if we loue the Lord, <note place="margin">We muſt ſet our harts vpon the Lord onely.</note> we ſhall injoy him, and hee alone will throughly ſatisfie vs with all joy and contentment.

                  <note place="margin">Hag. 1. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>much and bring in little, ye eate but ye haue not enough, ye drink but ye are not filled, ye clothe you, but ye be not warme, &amp; he that earneth wages, putteth the wages into a broken bag.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon hereof is, becauſe the Lord is the God of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who hath not giuen to his creatures any abſolute vertue and power, to attaine vnto the ends for which they were created in their owne ſtrength, without his further bleſsing; but hath reſerued vnto himſelfe a ſuperiour and ouer-ruling power, whereby he can reſtraine their vertue and make them weak &amp; impotent for any vſe. Yea, ſo can he ouer-rule them, that when he pleaſeth he can accompliſh by them contrary effects to their owne nature: as for example, if he with-draw his bleſsing, and lay his curſe vpon them, bread and meate haue no more power to nouriſh vs, then the earth or ſtones; nay contrariwiſe they ſerue as the inſtruments of death to bring vs to our end, and haue the ſame operation with dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poyſon, cauſing vs to fall into deſperate diſeaſes. Riches without Gods bleſsing doe not bring comfort and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but torment the poſſeſſour with care, and work in him a greedy inſatiableneſſe. Phyſick when God curſeth it, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in ſtead of curing; and the very ayre it ſelfe, which in it owne nature, refreſheth the vitall ſpirits, and preſerueth life, when Gods curſe lyeth on it, in ſtead of refreſhing poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoneth vs, and by the infection thereof, bringeth the plague and peſtilence.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is, that when the Lord hath giuen vnto <note place="margin">We muſt reſt on God in abundance as wel as in want.</note> vs plentie of meate, drinke, apparell, riches, and all manner of prouiſion, that we doe not reſt vpon, and truſt in our ſtore, as though being thus furniſhed we had no further neede of Gods helpe, which was the ſinne of the rich foole, Luk. 12. 19 who ſaid to his ſoule, <hi>Soule thou haſt much goods layed vp for many yeares, liue at eaſe, eate, drinck and take thy paſtime.</hi> For if we thus make an Idoll of our owne prouiſion, by truſting and relying on it more then on God himſelfe, the Lord in his juſt judgement will breake the ſtaffe of bread, and ſo we
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:10737:274"/> truſting to a broken ſtaffe are ſure to be moſt deceiued, when wee moſt reſt on it. Let vs therefore learne, not onely in the the time of want, but alſo when wee abound in all plentie, to beg at Gods hands our daily bread, and to be as earneſt in crauing his continuall bleſsing vpon that which hee hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready giuen vs, as in imploring the ſupply of our wants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we haue receiued it.</p>
               <p>The ſecond vſe ſerueth to comfort Gods poore ſeruants; <note place="margin">God maketh ſmall prouiſion ſufficient.</note> for ſeeing it is not in the vertue, and much leſſe the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of the foode which wee receiue principally, that we are nouriſhed, but in Gods bleſsing; therefore though their ſtore be ſmall, they may ſafely reſt vpon Gods prouidence, who as he can leaue little vertue in great ſtore, where he meaneth to curſe, ſo hee can adde double vertue to ſingle prouiſion, and make their ſmall pittance as ſufficient for the preſeruing of their health and ſtrength, as the great abundance of the rich. For as our Sauiour hath taught vs, <hi>We liue not by bread</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 4. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>onely, but by euery word which proceedeth out of the mouth of God</hi> Mat. 4. 4. If <hi>Elias</hi> haue but one meales meate, yet God can adde ſuch vertue to it, that in the ſtrength thereof hee ſhall bee able to trauaile fortie dayes; if the poore widdow wil depend vpon gods prouidence, though ſhe haue no more but a handfull of meale, and a cruſe of Oyle, yet it ſhall by Gods bleſsing be made ſufficient to preſerue her the whole time of dearth. Though <hi>Daniell</hi> and his fellowes haue onely <note place="margin">Dan. 1. 12. 15.</note> water and pulſe to feed vpon, becauſe they would not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe Gods commandement to haue better cheare, they ſhal thereby be fairer and in better liking, then they who eate the portion of the kings meate. And who doth not ſee by daily experience, that our poore country people, who feed for the moſt part vpon hard cheeſe, milke, and roots, through the bleſsing of God, haue greater ſtrength and better health, and longer life, then the richer ſort who pamper themſelues with all dainties?</p>
               <p>The laſt vſe is, that ſeeing we are for our nouriſhment to <note place="margin">We muſt make our prouiſion by lawfull meanes.</note> depend more vpon Gods bleſsing then vpon our owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſion, hence we learne to eate our bread in the ſweat of our
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:10737:274"/> browes, and to furniſh our ſtore by honeſt &amp; lawfull meanes, that ſo we may with comfort expect Gods bleſsing vpon our foode: otherwiſe if we make our prouiſion by wicked and vnlawfull meanes, though we haue abundance in poſſeſsion, yet we ſhall haue little comfort in the vſe, ſeeing we can haue no aſſurance of Gods bleſsing. For example, if any get their goods by fraud &amp; deceipt, how can they hope that the Lord will bleſſe them in their theft, ſeeing he hath plainly tould them, that <hi>they who eate the bread of deceipt their mouth ſhall be filled with grauell?</hi> Prou. 20. 17. How can they expect the <note place="margin">Pro. 20. 17.</note> bleſsing of God vpon that food which is gotten by oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and cruelty, whereby they eate the fleſh and drinke the bloud of the poore, as the Prophet ſpeaketh, Mich. 3. 3. <note place="margin">Mich. 3. 3.</note> Seeing their meats ſwimming in blood call for vengeance, and euen the ſtones in their walls, and the timber of their houſes cry vnto the Lord againſt them as it is Habac. 2. 11. <note place="margin">Habac. 2. 11.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The third thing to be obſerued is the diſpoſition of wicked men, who care not what vnlawfull meanes they vſe, ſo they <note place="margin">Wicked men vſe all vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes for the compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires.</note> may accompliſh their deſires. So the wicked prieſts coueting to haue children, who might inherit their wealth, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing their name might keepe them in perpetuall memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and not hauing their deſire ſatisfied by the ordinarie meanes of lawfull marriage, in ſtead of fleeing vnto God, who is the ſole author of generation, they take vnto them harlots, and ſo imagined that by multiplying their adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries they ſhould alſo haue multiplyed their poſteritie. Thus when men deſire to be rich, in ſtead of crauing Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on their honeſt labours, in whoſe hands the earth is &amp; all that therein is, Pſal. 24. 1. they fall to vſing vngodly and <note place="margin">Pſal. 24. 1.</note> vnhoneſt meanes, fraud and deceipt, oppreſsion, extorſion, and all manner of crueltie; when they affect aduancement they doe not ſeeke Gods honour, that he may honour them, but rather vſe Machiuilian pollicies to aduance themſelues, <note place="margin">1. Sam. 2. 31.</note> not caring ſo they may riſe though it be with the ruine of many others. And the reaſon hereof is, becauſe men truſt in themſelues more then in God, and depend more vpon their owne prouidence then on Gods promiſes; imagining
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:10737:275"/> that they are able to finde out a readier way, and a far more ſpeedy courſe, for the atchieuing of their deſires, then any is which God hath preſcribed. But oftentimes it commeth to paſſe, that they make more haſt then good ſpeede, the Lord fruſtrating their purpoſes, and bringing their counſailes to nought. Whileſt <hi>Achan</hi> ſought to bee preſently rich, and <note place="margin">Ioſ. 7.</note> would not ſtay Gods appoynted time, till he might injoy his portion in the Land of promiſe, he brought Gods fearefull judgement vpon himſelfe and all his familie. When <hi>Gehezie</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 King. 5.</note> laboured to inrich himſelfe by vnlawfull means, he got gods curſe with his gaines, euen the leproſie vpon himſelfe and all his poſteritie. When <hi>Abſolon</hi> would needs ſit on the throne <note place="margin">Ezek. 7. 10.</note> before his time, though hee purchaſed the crowne with his fathers head, he was hanged in a tree. When <hi>Haman</hi> would raiſe himſelfe, though it were with the ruine of all Gods <note place="margin">Eſter. 7. 10.</note> people, he was raiſed indeed, but it was vpon the Gallowes.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is, that as wee are to deſire nothing but <note place="margin">We muſt waite on Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the vſe of lawfull meanes.</note> that which is good, ſo wee are for the compaſsing of it to vſe onely lawfull and good meanes, wayting vpon Gods leaſure, and watching for his bleſsing vpon our honeſt indeauours; and then we may vndoubtedly hope, that if that which wee deſire be good for vs to receiue, the Lord will graunt it vnto vs, according to his promiſes. Pſal. 27. 14. <hi>Hope in the Lord, be</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 27. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>ſtrong and he ſhall comfort thine hart.</hi> So Pſal. 37. 34. <hi>Waite on the Lord, and keepe his way, and he ſhal exalt thee that thou ſhalt</hi>

                  <hi>will ſaue thee.</hi> But if we will preuent the Lord by our owne ſubtill meanes, and take a ſpeedier courſe for the compaſsing of our deſires, then hee hath preſcribed vs, namely, by our crafty fetches, and vnfaithfull and vnhoneſt dealing, let vs reſt aſſured that eyther the Lord will croſſe all our deuiſes, and fruſtrate all our wicked indeauours, or if we obtaine by theſe meanes the things which we deſire, they are giuen vnto vs in Gods wrath and not in his loue, and accordingly wee ſhall finde in the vſe of them a curſe and not a bleſsing.</p>

               <p> ANd thus much concerning the ſinnes and puniſhments, both of the Prieſts and people. Now whereas it might bee well wondred at, that the people who profeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues the people of God, a choſen nation, and more holy and religious then al others, &amp; that theſe prieſts who boaſted that they were the Prieſts of the Lord, and had the Law and teſtimonies, which they were dayly to reade, ſtudy and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh vnto the people, ſhould be beſotted with ignorance, and corrupted with ſo many enormious crimes: in the next words he rendreth the reaſon, namely, that they were become bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh in their ſinnes, becauſe by wallowing themſelues in bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh pleaſures, they were wholy infatuated and depriued of their vnderſtandings. This reaſon is expreſſed Verſe 11. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe </seg>11</label> 
                  <hi>Whoredome, and wine and new wine take away their heart.</hi> As though hee ſhould haue ſaid, it is no meruaile, that theſe <note place="margin">The expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> Prieſts and people, howſoeuer they make profeſsion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are ſottiſh in their ſinnes, and more like beaſts then men; ſeeing by addicting themſelues wholy to brutiſh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, they haue loſt the vſe of common reaſon, and haue no vnderſtanding in any good thing.</p>
               <p>But let vs more particularly ſet downe the meaning of the words: By <hi>Whoredome and wine</hi> ſome vnderſtand their Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and delight in ſuperſtition; but I rather take them in their literall ſenſe. Firſt, becauſe they better ſo agree with the verſe going before, wherevpon they ſeeme to depend, in the which they were condemned of voluptuouſnes. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe howſoeuer Idolatry is vſually ſignified by whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, yet delight in Superſtition, is not ſo fitly ſignified by wine. Thirdly, becauſe I hold it alwayes beſt and ſafeſt to reſt in the plaine and naturall meaning, and not to runne to Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories, when ſuch a ſenſe agreeth with the Analogie of faith, and with the circumſtances of the place.</p>
               <p>By Whoredome and Wine therefore, wee are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand generally all voluptuous pleaſures, and more eſpecially the ſinne of vncleanneſſe and drunkenneſſe, which aboue all other brutiſh pleaſures rob men of their hearts, and vnto
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:10737:276"/> which they were principally addicted, as before hath beene ſhewed. Neither are we ſo to take it, as though Wine in it ſelfe were a ſtealer of harts, ſeeing if it be moderately vſed, it cheareth and refreſheth the hart of man, and maketh him more ſit for Gods ſeruice, to which end it was created; but by Wine wee are here to vnderſtand the exceſsiue abuſe of Wine vnto drunkenneſſe, which taketh away the hart, and quite extinguiſheth the light of reaſon. Eſay. 28. 7. <note place="margin">Eſay. 28. 7.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is further added vnto Wine, <hi>New wine or ſweete wine,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 23. 30.</note> that by this repetion or rather addition he might amplyfie, and more fully ſet forth their voluptuous exceſſe in drinking, in that they mingled the new with the old, or when they were glutted with the one, vſed the other that ſo they might ſet an edge on their dulled appetites, and wher their cloyed intemperance, that thus they might gull it downe in greater abundance. So that by this addition he chargeth them, that not onely they were addicted to drunkenneſſe, being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken through the infirmitie of their nature, but that they did voluntarily wallow in this ſinne with delight, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would vſe it with greater pleaſure, they tryed new and wanton concluſions, and did as it were ſet vp a ſchoole of riot, and intemperance.</p>
               <p>Where by the way, he alſo tasketh their great ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, in that the better the Lord fed them, the more they kicked againſt him; the more liberally he multiplyed his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, the more they abuſed them to wantonneſſe, voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and all beaſtly Epicuriſme.</p>
               <p>It is further ſaid that Whoredome, Wine, and new Wine did take away their hart. Where by hart wee are to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand all the chiefe faculties of the ſoule, as the vnderſtanding and reaſon, the will and affections; ſo that through their voluptuouſneſſe their mindes were infatuated with blinde ignorance, their wils with-drawne from all goodneſſe, and their affections become ſo brutiſh that they delighted in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but in beaſtly ſenſualitie. And in this ſenſe the hart is vſually taken in the ſcriptures: for whereas man conſiſteth of two principall parts, the body and the ſoule, the body is

               <p>And this is the meaning of the words: the doctrines are <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The doctrine. </seg>
                  </label> theſe. Firſt, we may obſerue, that proſperitie and abundance <note place="margin">The abuſe of proſperitie through our corruption.</note> are the cauſes why men wallow themſelues in voluptuous pleaſures; not in their owne nature, for being ſo conſidered they are Gods good bleſsings and benefits, but as through our corruption, they are abuſed vnto ſinne. And this ſheweth the poyſonous contagion of our natures, which ſo infecteth Gods creatures, that of wholeſome drinkes they become deadly potions, of good euill, and of bleſsings curſes. The more God inlargeth our proſperitie, and multiplyeth his benefits, the better wee ſhould remember and loue him, the more thankfull we ſhould be vnto him, the more zealous of his glory, the more dutifull, obedient, &amp; diligent in his ſeruice, ſeeing like a bountifull maiſter he doth ſo richly reward our labors. And the more we abound in gods bleſsings, the more ſobrietie and temperance we ſhould ſhew in the vſe of them; for we need not to be rauenouſly greedy at a full table, and the greatneſſe of the cheare ſhould rather abate then whet our appetites. But ſuch is the hatefull corruption of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that we make a quite contrary vſe of Gods benefits; for when men are inriched with them, they forget God, they ſet their harts on the world, they neuer returne praiſe to the author of all their good, they wax key cold in their deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, vndutifull, negligent, idle and wholy addict themſelues to voluptuous pleaſures, waſtfully misſpending Gods bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings in exceſſe, riot, wantonneſſe, and belly-cheare, whereby they are made altogether vnſit to performe any ſeruice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and moſt fit to ſerue ſathan, ſinne, the world, and the luſts of their owne fleſh. An example whereof wee haue in this place; for when the Prieſts and people flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in proſperity, and abounded in wealth, they gaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to all voluptuouſnes, to Whoredome and drunkennes,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:10737:277"/> whereby they were wholy infatuated, and became ignorant and forgetfull of Gods Law, negligent in their callings, and vnfit for any good duties. Many other examples might bee brought to illuſtrate this point. The Sodomites inhabiting a <note place="margin">Gen. 13. 8.</note> place which was ſo inriched with Gods benefits that it was like another Paradize in pleaſant ſtore, abuſed theſe gifts of God to pride, gluttony, drunkenneſſe and all manner of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull <note place="margin">Ezech. 16. 49.</note> luſts. The Iſraelites for a little while abounding in a place of want, in ſtead of praiſing God for his benefits, ſate <note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note> downe to eate and drinke and roſe vp to play. The rich glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, <note place="margin">Luke. 16.</note> hauing ſtore of wealth, ſpent it all in purple, fine linnen, and delicate faire, but had not of all his prouiſion one meals meate to giue vnto <hi>Lazarus.</hi> And the other rich man ſurna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the foole, when he had filled his barnes, and furniſhed himſelfe with ſtore, in ſtead of reſoluing to praiſe God for <note place="margin">Luk. 12. 19.</note> his benefits, and to imploy them ſo as he might bee glorified in the vſe of his owne gifts, reſolueth to liue at eaſe, to eate, drinck and take his paſtime.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this doctrine is: firſt, to admoniſh thoſe who flouriſh in proſperitie, and abound in Gods bleſsings that they be carefull in imploying them to Gods glory, and ſo to vſe them, that they may ſerue as helps to further them, in all holy and religious duties; for ſuch is our naturall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if wee doe not preuent it with watchfull diligence, we ſhall abuſe Gods bounty, and imploy our abundance for the pampering of the fleſh in all voluptuouſneſſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond vſe ſerueth for the reproofe of many in theſe dayes, who being inriched with all abundant ſtore, think vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon no better vſe of Gods bleſsings, but to conſume them in pride, exceſſe, gormandize, and drunkenneſſe, neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that where the Lord giueth greateſt wages, there he requireth moſt diligent ſeruice, nor that hee beſtoweth vpon them abundance, that they may ſupply others wants, and out of their ſuperfluitie relieue the poores neceſsitie. If it be to maintaine Hawks and Hounds, and Harlots, exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue brauery, gluttony, drinking and good fellowſhip, they care not to ſpend many hundreds, but they can ſcarce afford
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:10737:277"/> a penny to the reliefe of Chriſts poore members, when as they are ready to pine with hunger.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to bee obſerued is, that as voluptuous <note place="margin">Voluptuous pleaſures tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme men into beaſts, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally whordome &amp; drunkennes.</note> pleaſures doe take away the vnderſtanding and transforme men into beaſts, ſo eſpecially whoredome and drunkennes: for firſt, for Whoredome, it maketh wiſe men fooles, and ſo infatuateth and beſotteth the vnderſtanding, that there is no place left, not onely for ſpirituall wiſedome, but not ſo much as for reaſon and common ſenſe. For they who are addicted to this vice, care not ſo they may ſatisfie their carnall luſts, though they runne headlong and blinde-fold into all miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes; they expoſe their name to infamie and reproach; they waſt their ſubſtance in maintaining Harlots, and bring themſelues to extreame pouertie; they are ſo blinded that they cannot ſee the odious behauiour, the ſhameleſſe impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and vglie filthineſſe of their Harlots, but are ready to judge their vices vertues, and to eſteeme them of greater excellence then any other; they caſt off all care of wife and children, as though they were meere ſtrangers; they lay aſide all ſhame, and thinke nothing ſo filthy which they may not ſpeake, nothing ſo vnciuill which they may not doe in any preſence; they conſume their ſtrength, infect their bodyes with loathſome diſeaſes, ſhorten their liues, and damne their owne ſoules. And all theſe miſchiefes they runne into to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie their filthy luſts, and to injoy a ſhort and brutiſh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Hence it is that the Heathen called <hi>Venus</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">

And hereof it is that the ſin of vncleanneſſe by a certaine kinde of eminence is in the Sciptures called folly, and the Adulterers fooles. So <hi>Sichem</hi> when hee deflowred <hi>Dina,</hi> is ſaid to haue committed folly in Iſraell. Gen. 34. 7.

               <p>The vſe hereof is, that euery one abſtaine from fornication, and poſſeſſe his veſſell in holineſſe and honour, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle exhorteth. 1 Theſ. 4. 3.

               <p>The laſt thing to bee obſerued is, that they who addict <note place="margin">There is no meane or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in vnlawfull pleaſures</note> themſelues to pleaſures, are ſo wholy ouer-ruled by their luſts that they can obſerue no meane or moderation, but grow from delight to curious wantonneſſe, and when they haue ſatisfied their naturall luſts and euen dulled and cloyed their ſenſuall appetites, they fall to deuice how by art they may renew &amp; ſharpen them. In which reſpect theſe voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men are far worſe then many other ſinners, whoſe ſtate neuertheleſſe is moſt damnable; namely ſuch as perſeuere in their ſinnes without repentance, and will not leaue ſinne till ſinne leaue them; but theſe after their ſins haue forſaken them, there being wanting naturall ſtrength and meanes for <note place="margin">Pro. 23. 30</note> the acting of them, will not forſake their ſinnes, but vſe all alluring meanes to intertaine them ſtill, and earneſtly indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to renew their ſtrength that they may renew their wickedneſſe. Thus theſe drunkards when they were glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with wine, they added new wine, the one hauing ſtrength to inflame them, the other delightfull ſweetneſſe to allure them, that ſo by this varietie they might ſet an edge on their
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:10737:278"/> dulled appetite, and make them as it were long-winded and vnwearied in this drunken exerciſe. So the glutton when he hath cloyed his ſtomacke, with ſurfetting and gormandize, and ſatisfied, yea oppreſſed nature with loathing ſacietie, he laboureth by art to repaire nature, and to thruſt it forward by invention, vvhen as it is quite tyred; not onely by varietie of diſhes, the more daintie and delicate following the groſſer and more common faire, but by innumerable ſorts of ſauces, the vſuall harbingers of gluttony and exceſſe. So that now cookery is become an ingenious profeſsion, and requireth as much time to make an exquiſite proficient, as ſome one of the liberall Sciences. The like alſo may be ſaid of Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours and Adulterers, vvho vvhen they haue tyred nature, and conſumed their ſtrength, labour to re-enable their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled concupiſcence by exquiſite wantonneſſe, and when they are ſatisfied as being beaſts, they remaine inſatiable as being men, their reaſonable or rather vnreaſonable luſt farre exceeding their ſenſuall concupiſcence. Hence it is, that when their luſt hath out-run their ſtrength, they labour to refreſh it by obſcoene ſpeeches, wanton Pictures, vnhoneſt daliance, inflaming drincks, pampring meates, Italian rootes, and when all this will not ſuffice, they hire the noble art of Phyſicke it ſelfe, to become a baude to their vncleanneſſe, as though they could not run faſt enough vnto hell, vnleſſe they haſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned their ſpeede by laying all theſe Poſt-horſes in the way.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is, that we giue voluptuouſnes her anſwere <note place="margin">We muſt reſiſt voluptuouſnes at the firſt.</note> when ſhe maketh her firſt motion, and turne it away with a frowning countenance when it firſt knocketh at the doore of our harts.

Firſt, it will allure nature, then delight it, then ſatisfie it, then glut it with loathſome ſatietie, and when it is quite ſpent and tyred, it will finde meanes to refreſh it by curioſitie and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe for a new conflict, but ſo as it is ſure to receiue the greater foyle.</p>

               <p> AND ſo much concerning the third bill of inditement; wherein the people of Iſraell, eſpecially the Prieſts are accuſed and conuicted of diuers haynous crimes. Now leaſt the people ſhould thinke their faults extenuated, and themſelues acquitted either from the guilt or puniſhment of their ſinnes, becauſe they were miſlead by their blinde and wicked guides, he teturneth againe vnto them, and frameth againſt them a new bill of inditement, wherein he accuſeth them, that they wilfully joyned with their falſe teachers in their Idolatry, &amp; were well contented to be guided by them, rather then by Gods true Prophets; and therefore it was juſt with God, that both the blinde leaders and blinde fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers ſhould fall together into the pit of deſtruction, ſeeing they both wilfully did ſhut their eyes, and loued the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ignorance far better then the ſhining light of Gods truth.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In which words is contayned two things: firſt, their ſin: <note place="margin">The expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> ſecondly, the cauſe thereof. Their ſinne in theſe words: <hi>My people aske counſaile of their ſtockes, and their ſtaffe teacheth them.</hi> Where firſt is ſet downe the perſons who committed this wickedneſſe, and then the qualitie of their ſinne is alſo expreſſed. The perſons are ſaide to be not Heathens and Pagans, but the people of God. <hi>My people aske counſaile, &amp;c.</hi> by which high title it is not his purpoſe to grace them with any priuiledge of honour, or to preferre them before the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and infidels, but rather he raiſeth them vp that he may

As though he ſhould haue ſaide, if theſe outragious ſinnes be not to be excuſed in the gentiles and infidells, who haue onely the dimme light of Nature to be their guide, and whom I haue vouchſafed but common fauours; then how intollerable is this wickednes being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by this people of Iſraell, vnto whom aboue all the nations of the earth, I haue vouchſafed this royall priuiledge and prerogatiue, to be called my choſen and peculiar people? vnto whom I haue giuen my lawes, ſtatutes, and ordinances for their direction, and my Sacraments as aſſured ſeales of my loue and fauour; vpon whom I haue multiplyed innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable benefits to incourage them in my ſeruice: who haue abounded with Oracles of infallible truth, as the euent hath proued, and haue continually had my Prophets to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them in their doubts, and to guide them in all truth: euen this vngratefull people, after all theſe benefits receiued, haue cauſleſly forſaken me and no necesſitie vrging them haue conſulted with their Idols. Neither is this haynous fault committed by ſome few perſons, but as though they had made a common conſpiracie, the whole body of the people haue aſſociated and combined themſelues together as one man, in this apoſtacie and Idolatrie.</p>
               <p>The like place vnto this we haue Ier. 2. 10. 11. &amp;c. Where the Lord ſendeth his people to the gentiles, to ſee if they <note place="margin">Ier. 2. 10. 11.</note> could finde the like wickedneſſe committed by them againſt their Idols, which they had committed againſt him the true and euerliuing God.</p>
               <p>The ſinne committed by this people is, that they did <hi>aske councell at their ſtocks, and their ſtaffe did teach them,</hi> In which words their ſinnes are both expreſſed, and alſo their folly in committing of them exceedingly aggrauated. But let vs come to the meaning of the words. Some expoſiters not to be neglected, do vnderſtand them allegorically, as though by woode and ſtaffe were meant, their ignorant and falſe
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:10737:280"/> Prophets, vpon whom they did reſt &amp; relie for their direction in the right way, as the blinde asketh counſaile, and relyeth for his direction in his way vpon his ſtaffe. But Allegories are needleſſe where the literall ſenſe is more probable, and agreeable with the Text; and beſides it ſeemeth to me a farre fetched and vnvſual Allegory, to ſignifie falſe Prophets by wood and ſtaues, and therefore I rather thinke that as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generall he accuſeth them of their Idolatry, in that they did goe vnto Idols, call vpon and worſhip them; ſo more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that they did conſult with them and aske their counſaile and direction about future euents.</p>
               <p>The particular ſinne therefore whereof he accuſeth them was their Idolatrous and ſuperſtitious diuinations, whereof as there were many kindes, according to the diuers inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which they vſed, as diuining by Oracles, by Lots, by fire and water, by flying of Birds, and looking into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trailes of Beaſts, by their tripodes, dead bodyes, and the like; ſo were there amongſt them theſe two ſpeciall kindes here mentioned, namely, when in their diuinations they vſed wod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Author libri.</hi> 613. <hi>manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and alſo when as for the ſame purpoſe they vſed certaine crooked wands or ſticks, which were fitted for their vſe, with certaine Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, Pictures, and Characters written on them. The which kinde of Diuination was called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of which <hi>Liuie</hi> in his Romaine Hiſtory and M. <hi>Cicero</hi> in his bookes of Diuination maketh mention. So that their ſin here condemned was, that they forſooke the Lord, and his true Prophets, and refuſing their direction, did conſult with their Idols and Images, for the knowledge of future events; vſing many heatheniſh ſuperſtitions, and diuelliſh Ceremonies for this purpoſe. An example of this ſinne we <note place="margin">Ezech. 21. 21.</note> haue in the king of Babell, Ezech. 21. 21. <hi>And the King of Babell ſtood in the parting of the way, at the head of two wayes, conſulting by Diuination, and made his kniues bright</hi> (namely, which he vſed in killing and cutting vp his ſacrifices) <hi>he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with Idols and looked into the Liuer.</hi> All which kinds of abhominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s vvere in the Iſraelits much more abhominable,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:10737:280"/> ſeeing they had the law of God, wherein they were expreſly condemned, as appeareth Leu. 20. 27. Deut. 8. 10. 11. 12. <note place="margin">Leu 20. 27. Deut 18. 10. 11</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now this their ſinne is further aggrauated by diuers ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; firſt, by their ſhameleſſe impudency, in that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they conſulted with theſe Idols, and vſed all theſe diuelliſh ceremonies, yet they ſtill boaſted that they did not worſhip nor conſult with the Images themſelues, but God in the Image. And therfore it is not ſaid that they did aske counſaile of their Images, but in their Images, for ſo the Text hath it; that is, vſed them as their inſtruments, wherein they boaſted that they conſulted with the true God. Secondly, he doth not ſimply ſay that they conſulted with an Image or ſtaffe, but <hi>they aske counſaile in their wood, and their ſtaffe teacheth them,</hi> ſignifying hereby that they had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned no ſuch thing out of Gods word, where all ſuch practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are condemned as moſt odious abhominations, but that they were their owne will-worſhips, humaine inventions, and diuelliſh ſuperſtitions.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, he aggrauateth their ſinne, by their ſottiſh follie, in that they had not onely refuſed the counſaile and direction of the moſt wiſe and all-ſeeing God, but alſo had made choyſe of baſe and blinde Idols made of wood and ſtone to be their guides and counſailours; which were in other things (though not in this) far more ſenſleſſe then themſelues, and ſuffered themſelues to bee aduiſed and directed by their ſtaues, which were not onely deſtitute of vnderſtanding, but alſo of ſenſe and motion. but as it pleaſed themſelues to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, moue, turne and rule them, herein like vnto blind men, who refer themſelues ouer to be guided by their ſtaffe in their way which themſelues carry. Yea, in truth herein farre more blinde and extreamely ſottiſh, in that the blinde mans ſtaffe, howſoeuer it doth ſometimes deceiue, yet moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it helpeth him to auoide dangers, whereas theſe men ſuffering themſelues to be guided by theſe ſtaues of diuelliſh ſuperſtition, are thereby miſled into the deepe pit of eternall deſtruction.</p>
               <p>This ſottiſh folly of idolaters is moſt excellently deciphered
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:10737:281"/> by the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> Chap. 44. 14. 15. 16. where he ſaith, <note place="margin">Eſa. 40. 20. 21. and 44. 14. 15.</note> that the blinde Idolater taketh a tree out of the forreſt, <hi>and burneth the halfe thereof euen in the fire, and vpon the halfe thereof he eateth fleſh, he roſteth the roſt, and is ſatisfied, alſo he warmeth himſelfe and ſaith, Aha, I am warme, I haue beene at the fire,</hi> Verſe 17. <hi>And the reſidue thereof he maketh a God, euen his Idoll, he boweth vnto it, and worſhippeth and prayeth vnto it, and ſaith, deliuer me for thou art my God, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this was the ſinne of the people of Iſraell: the cauſe whereby they became ſo deepely beſotted in this wickednes, is rendred in the next words: <hi>For the ſpirit of Fornications hath cauſed them to erre, and they haue gone a whoring from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their God.</hi> Where the Prophet ſheweth that it was no meruaile they ſo fouly erred out of the way of truth, ſeeing they were wholy miſlead by a ſpirit of Fornications, which made them to goe a whoring from vnder their God.</p>
               <p>Now by this ſpirit of Fornications we are to vnderſtand not onely the vncleane ſpirit Sathan, vvho leadeth men into all manner of ſpirituall and corporall filthineſſe, but more eſpecially that vehement proanneſſe and feruent inclination vnto this ſpirituall whoredome and Idolatrie, which vvas deepely rooted in the hearts of the people: for vehement af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and earneſt inclinations, are with the Hebrewes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ſpirit of ſuch things as are ſo earneſtly affected: as the ſpirit of Ielouſie: Num. 5. 14. The ſpirit of Lying: 1 King. <note place="margin">Num. 5. 14. 1. King. 22. 13. Eſay. 19. 14. and 29. 10. Zach. 13. 2. 1 Iohn. 4. 6.</note> 22. 13. The ſpirit of Giddineſſe: Eſay. 19. 14. The ſpirit of Drouſineſſe: Eſay. 29. 10. The ſpirit of Vncleanneſſe: Zach 13. 2. The ſpirit of error. 1 Ioh. 4. 6. In all which places is ſignified the exceeding proannes of mans corrupt nature vnto theſe euils, as though the very ſoule it ſelf were wholy ſet vpon them, or as if the ſoule were not ſo much the ſubject of the vices, and they the adjuncts, as the vices the ſubject of the Soule. And further this proanneſſe is called a ſpirit Meto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimically, to point out vnto vs the chiefe authour and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine from whence it is diriued, euen Sathan the ſpirit of all wickedneſſe.</p>
               <p>Moreouer it is called the ſpirit of fornications, rather then
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:10737:281"/> the ſpirit of idolatrie, not onely becauſe he would perſiſt in the former allegorie of marriage, but alſo that hereby he might point out as it were in liuely colours the diſpoſition of idolaters. As though he would ſay, it fareth with theſe filthy idolaters, as with vncleane adulterers; who are ſo blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and inflamed with their luſt, and ſo beſotted and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by their vice, that without either ſhame or wit, like brute beaſts they runne headlong into their ſinne, and into all thoſe miſcheifes which doe accompany it, as though they were vtterly depriued of all judgement and vnderſtanding. And for this cauſe alſo he vſeth the plurall number <hi>forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,</hi> rather then the ſingular, to note both their furious earneſtneſſe and their accuſtomed practiſe in committing this ſinne.</p>
               <p>Whereby he plainly ſheweth that howſoeuer their Prieſts vtterly neglected their duty, yet were not the people hereby excuſed of their ſinnes; both becauſe they gaue themſelues to voluptuous pleaſures and thereby were depriued of their vnderſtandings, and became proane vnto all wickednes, and alſo becauſe they were not onely outwardly miſlead by their falſe teachers, but alſo had inwardly in themſelues a ſpirit of fornications, that is, a vehement proneſſe vnto idolatry, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they were wholy beſotted.</p>
               <p>Finally he addeth, <hi>And they haue gone a Whoring from vnder their God,</hi> that is, they haue quite ſhaken off the marriage yoke, and with-drawing themſelues from vnder the gouernment and ſubjection of God their lawfull husband, haue wholy giuen themſelues ouer to ſpirituall vncleannes, and to commit whordome with their impure Idols. The which words may be vnderſtood as a cauſe of the former, that they therefore forſooke the Lord, and gaue themſelues ouer to be ruled by their Idols, becauſe they were poſſeſſed with a ſpirit of fornications which cauſed them to fall into theſe groſſe and abſurde errours, or as an effect, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were miſlead by the ſpirit of fornications, becauſe hauing forſaken the Lord and his truth, he had giuen them ouer to a reprobate ſenſe, &amp; ſuffred them to be deluded by a
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:10737:282"/> ſpirit of errour, &amp; with ſtrong deluſions, becauſe they would not imbrace nor loue the truth. For theſe are mutual and reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall cauſes, to imbrace falſe worſhip &amp; idolatrie, &amp; to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake God; for when the idolater beginneth to worſhip his idols, hee renounceth the worſhip of God, and when he will not loue nor delight himſelfe in Gods true worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, then the Lord giueth vp him to a reprobate ſenſe, and to be deluded with ſtrong deluſions, as the Apoſtle ſheweth, Rom. 1. 23. 24. 2 Theſ. 2. 11. <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 23. 24. 2. Theſ. 2. 11.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo much concerning the meaning of the words: the <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The doctrines. </seg>
                  </label> doctrines which ariſe out of them are diuers. Firſt, we may obſerue that it is no true honour to grace vs, nor any ſound <note place="margin">The title of Gods people doth not grace or profit vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſie we liue like the people of God.</note> benefit to profit and comfort vs, that wee beare the title of Gods people, and abound in his temporall gifts and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, if our life be not conformable to our titles and priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and if wee doe not thankfully imploy Gods benefits beſtowed vpon vs, to the aduancement of his glory, the good of his Church, and the furthering of our owne ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: yea contrariwiſe if wee vſe them as incouragements to harten vs in our ſinnes, and vngratefully abuſe them to Gods diſhonour and the diſgrace of our profesſion, making them ſerue as vayles vnder which we may more cunningly hide our leprous ſores of ſinne and cloſe acted wickedneſſe; then are they ſo farre from gracing vs that they wholy tend to our diſcredit, and ſo farre from being truely profitable, that they ſerue as ſo many arguments to aggrauate our ſinnes, and to approue the juſtice of Gods righteous judgements when as hee taketh the moſt rigourous courſe in inflicting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It was an high priuiledge of honour to the people of Iſraell to be intitled the people of God, but when they contemned his true worſhip, forſooke the Lord, and conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Idols, all this tended to their vtter diſgrace, and to make their idolatrie much more abhominable then the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie of the Gentils. So it was a great dignitie to the wicked Angels, that they were created the moſt excellent of the creatures, and were made the immediate Miniſters of God, and as it were courtiars to the great King of heauen and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:10737:282"/> earth; but when as they moſt vngratfully ſinned againſt ſuch as gratious creator, their excellencie did not benefit them, but aggrauated their ſinne and plunged them into the deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt bottome of juſt condemnation. It was a great mercie of God vouchſafed to the Sodomites, that they were placed in <note place="margin">Gen. 13. 8.</note> the garden of the world, where they abounded in all Gods temporall bleſsings, but when they abuſed Gods goodneſſe and by his benefits became more rebellious, they were not hereby priuiledged from puniſhment, but inflamed Gods <note place="margin">Gen. 19.</note> more fearefull wrath againſt themſelues, which cauſed fire and brimſtone to raine downe from heauen and conſume them. It was a great priuiledge to the Iſraelites, to be the vineyard of the Lord, which he had hedged in from the reſt of the world for his owne vſe and delight, but when they anſwered not to Gods mercy in their obedience, but in ſtead of the ſweet grapes of righteouſnes, brought forth the ſowre <note place="margin">Eſay. 5.</note> grapes of ſinne, the Lord did not onely forſake it, but alſo pull downe the hedge, and layde it open to the common ſpoyle. It was a ſingular prerogatiue vnto them, that they had amongſt them the profeſsion of Religion, and the Temple of God, the place of Gods worſhip; but when they abuſed it as a viſard of hypocriſie, to countenance their ſinne, and as a ſhield to fence off all Gods threatnings of puniſhment, God ſendeth them to Shilo to ſee a patterne of his fearefull <note place="margin">Ier. 7. 4. 12.</note> vengeance, which ſhould alſo ouer-take them vnleſſe they repented. Finally, it was a great dignitie, and royall priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to the people of the Iewes, that they injoyed all earthly benefits in the land of Canaan, that they were Gods pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar people, with whom he had made his couenant; his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen nation; his royall Prieſt-hood; the treaſurers of his word; the keepers of his ſeales; and that they had the firſt offer of eternall ſaluation by Chriſt, and of the joyfull tidings of the Goſpell: but when they abuſed this rich mercy by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their rebellion, by ſtopping their eares to Chriſts heauenly Sermons; by crucifying the Lord of Life; and by continuing in finall impenitencie, after they were long cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led there vnto by the preaching of the Apoſtles; all Gods

               <p>By all which it appeareth that Gods benefits are not bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings <note place="margin">Gods bleſsings abuſed doe ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauate our ſinnes.</note> vnto vs if we doe abuſe them as motiues vnto ſinne, but rather they make our ſinnes out of meaſure ſinfull, and our puniſhments more intollerable. And of this the reaſon is moſt apparant; for as it excuſeth the neglect of dutie, when the partie to whom it is to be performed is but a meere ſtranger, and extenuateth the fault, when as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt an enimie, ſo it doth much aggrauate it, if he be a familiar acquaintance, or neere friend, vnto whom we are deepely indebted for many benefits: if the wife do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeane her ſelfe towards a crabbed and perverſe husband, though it doth not altogether excuſe her, yet it extenuateth her fault; but if ſhe thus behaue her ſelfe towards a husband who is moſt kinde and louing, and omitteth no good duty which can be required of him, the world is ready to crie ſhame againſt ſuch misbehauior. If the ſeruant neglecteth his duty to ſuch a maiſter as performeth no duty vnto him, but defraudeth him of his wages, and daily oppreſſeth him with new injuries, although it will not juſtifie his doings, yet it will leſſen his faults; but if this neglect be towards ſuch a one as is louing and liberall, it deſerueth juſtly a ſharper cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and more ſeuere puniſhment. So if the Lord were vnto vs as a ſtranger or enimie, a bitter husband, or cruell maiſter, we might haue ſom-what to ſay for the neglect of our duty; but ſeeing he is moſt bountifull and benigne, requiting eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dramme of loue with a pound of kindneſſe, and rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding euery penny-worth of ſeruice, with a talent of wages, yea, ſeeing he preuenteth vs with his free grace, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and continueth, and multiplyeth his benefits without any manner of our deſerts, if after all this we neglect our duties to ſuch a God, ſo gracious, and infinite in mercy, yea,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:10737:283"/> and contrariwiſe abuſe his owne gifts to his diſhonour, and take occaſion by his benefits the more to prouoke his wrath by our ſinnes, what judgements are too heauy, what puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments too grieuous for ſuch vnthankfull wretches?</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof ſerueth to teach vs, not to content ous ſelues <note place="margin">We muſt not content our ſelues with the priuiledges of Chriſtians vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe we liue their liues.</note> with the priuileges of Chriſtians, vnleſſe we liue the liues of Chriſtians; not to reſt in Gods temporall benefits as being ſufficient arguments of his loue, or vndoubted pledges of our ſaluation, vnleſſe we haue alſo the grace giuen vs to imploy them to the aduancement of Gods glorie, and to vſe them to thoſe good and holy ends for which God hath beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. For it will nothing avayle vs that we are choſen out of the reſt of the world to be Gods peculiar people, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe as it becommeth the inheritance of God we be purged from our iniquities and be zealous of good workes; it will <note place="margin">Tit. 2. 14.</note> not profit vs to be intertayned into Gods owne familie, if we doe not behaue our ſelues as it becommeth his children and ſeruants; nor to haue the couenant and the ſeales thereof, the glorious Goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt, and the Sacraments of Baptiſme and the Lords ſupper, vnleſſe this couenant be as well written in our harts as in our bookes, and be as fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully practized, as it is faithfully deliuered. In a word wee ſhall be neuer the better for the abundance of temporall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits as peace, plenty, health, libertie, and the reſt, vnleſſe as wee ſurpaſſe others in theſe priuiledges and pledges of Gods loue, ſo alſo we doe excell them in loue towards God, zeale, thankfulneſſe, and holy obedience: yea contrariwiſe if God haue ſowen amongſt vs the ſeeds of his mercies with a liberall hand, expecting a fruitfull harueſt of holyneſſe &amp; righteouſneſſe, and we in ſtead hereof returne vnto him the ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſerueth to beate downe the glorious braggs of the Papiſts and ſinagogue of Rome, who boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues as being the peculiar people and Church of God,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:10737:284"/> vpon whom the Lord hath multiplyed manifold benefits ſpiritual &amp; temporal, and in whoſe cuſtody ſtill remaine the treaſure of Gods word, and his ſeales the Sacraments: but though it ſhould be graunted vnto them that their Church in former times hath had theſe priuiledges, and that yet there remaine ſome ſteps and prints of them, this doth not any whit commend them or make their ſtate the better, yea rather it ſerueth to aggrauate their fearfull Apoſtaſie, their haynous rebellion, and abhominable idolatrie, in which they liue and perſeuere, notwithſtanding the Lord hath former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dealt ſo gratiouſly with them, and preſently doth not take that juſt vengeance of their ſinnes, which they long agoe deſerued. For howſoeuer the Lord hath cauſed the light of the Goſpell to ſhine vnto them, whereby he hath diſcouered the ſottiſh groſenes of their idolatrie and ſuperſtitions, yet they will not forſake their idols <hi>and turne to the liuing God,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Acts. 14. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>who hath made heauen and earth,</hi> but like vnto the Iſraelites here ſpoken of, they worſhip their images of wood &amp; ſtone, and daily commit more then heatheniſh idolatrie; they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with their idols in all their difficulties and dangers, going on pilgrimage vnto them for their counſaile and direction; they make vowes vnto them, &amp; offer them oblations in euery high place, that is, in the innumerable temples which they haue erected for this purpoſe; and they are ſo wholy ſeduced by the ſpirit of fornications, that if any man gaine ſay them in theſe their wicked courſes, they are ready to purſue and perſecute him with ſword, fire, and fagot. In a word they haue wholy corrupted Gods worſhip and ſeruice, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more ſottiſh in their ſuperſtitions and idolatrie, then either the Turkes or Pagans. So that if they will needes vaunt themſelues of their titles, that they are Gods people and Church, and in their priuiledges which they haue aboue others, they doe but glory in their ſhame, ſeeing they are ſo many arguments to aggrauate their ſinnes and vngratefull wickedneſſe, in that they are worſe then the Turkes and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels in her idolatrie and ſuperſtition, eſpecially in this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that they haue had many ſingular meanes graunted
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:10737:284"/> them by God for their converſion and reformation, which the other haue wanted, and yet notwithſtanding all Gods mercies, perſiſt in their apoſtacie and rebellion.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be obſerued is, that the Lord con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth <note place="margin">That it is an haynous ſinne to worſhip Images.</note> it as a haynous ſinne, to worſhip Images, and to aske counſaile of ſtocks &amp; ſtones. And in truth what groſer Idolatry can be imagined then to giue that honour and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which is proper the vnto Lord, to the works of mens hands, as to fall downe before a baſe Idoll, to creep vnto it, to invocate it, and to offer vnto it vowes and oblations? neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe how ſottiſhly abſurd ſoeuer this Idolatry be, yet hath it many patrones amongſt thoſe who make profeſsion of Chriſtianitie, namely, the whole Church of Rome, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low by their doctrine and practiſe, both the making and worſhipping of Images, not onely of God himſelfe and the three perſons in Trinitie, but alſo of Angels and Saints. But we are to abhorre this groſe Idolatry, as being in the word of God condemned as impious, and derided as ſottiſh and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous. It is expreſly condemned in the ſecond commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make vnto thy ſelfe any grauen Image, &amp;c.</hi> So Deut. 4. 15. <hi>Take therefore good heede vnto your ſelues,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 4. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>for yee ſaw no Image in the day that the Lord ſpake vnto you in Horeb, out of the middeſt of the fire.</hi> 16. <hi>That you corrupt not your ſelues, and make you a grauen Image, or repreſentation of any figure, whether it be male or female, &amp;c.</hi> So Leu. 19. 4. <note place="margin">Leuit. 19. 4. &amp; 26. 1. Eſay. 40. 18.</note> and 26. 1. Eſa. 40. 18. And leaſt we ſhould thinke that this was onely a legall ordinance, which is abrogated by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, as one of the Papiſts doth impudently affirme, it is no <note place="margin">Catharinus.</note> leſſe ſtrictly vrged in the new Teſtament, and the neglect thereof condemned, as appeareth. Rom. 1. 23. 1 Cor. 10. 20 <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 23. 1 Cor. 10. 20. 1 Iohn. 5. 21.</note> 1 Iohn. 5. 21.</p>
               <p>And as the Lord hath ſtrictly forbidden and condemned this ſinne, ſo alſo hath he ſeuerely puniſhed it, as we may ſee in the example of the Iſraelits, Exod. 32. In the time of the <note place="margin">Exodus. 32.</note> Iudges, and of the Kings, of <hi>Ieroboam, Ahab,</hi> and the reſt, <note place="margin">Deut. 27. 15. Pſal. 97. 7.</note> according to his word. Deut. 27. 15. Pſal. 97. 7.</p>
               <p>But as the Lord hath condemned the making and
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:10737:285"/> worſhipping of Images as wicked, ſo alſo as ſottiſh and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, as may appeare. Pſal. 115. 4. 5. &amp;c. And 135. 16. <note place="margin">Pſal. 115. 4. 5.</note> 17. &amp;c. Eſay. 40. 20. 21. &amp;c. And 44. Ver. 9. to 21.</p>
               <p>But it is objected by the Papiſts that Images are Lay <note place="margin">The Papiſts confuted who ſay that images are Lay mens bookes.</note> mens books. I anſwer that if Lay men haue no better books, the greater is the Cleargies ſinne, for the Lord hath giuen the bookes of holy Scriptures, not onely vnto them, but to the Laytie alſo, that by ſtudying therein they may be led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all truth; but they vſe them like little children or fooles, for taking away from them the rich treaſure of Gods word, in ſtead thereof they giue vnto them babies and pictures to play withall, to keep them as it were from crying and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playning. They take away from them the profitable ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſter which would throughly inſtruct them in the will of God, becauſe hereby all their jugling and deceipt would be diſcouered; and giue them Images to be their play-fellowes. Yea, in truth they deale farre worſe with Gods people, for childiſh babies, and play-fellowes, are vnto children harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe delights, whereas theſe Images are pernitious vnto their ſoules, by ſeducing them out of the way of truth into the way of errour and falſhood, as the Scriptures plainely teach vs. Ier. 10. 15. They are called <hi>vanitie and the work of errour,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 10. 15.</note> not onely becauſe they groſly erre that make, but they alſo that ſerue them. They teach men indeed, but what is their doctrine? euen <hi>the doctrine of vanitie,</hi> as it is Verſe 8. They vſe a kinde of dumbe eloquence to perſwade ſimple men, but what is it they ſpeake? The Prophet <hi>Zacharie</hi> telleth vs, Zach. 10. 2. <hi>Surely the Idols haue ſpoken vanitie.</hi> They <note place="margin">Zach. 10. 2.</note> teach Ideots, but what is their leſſon? the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Hab. 2. 18.</note> telleth vs, Chap. 2. ver. 18. <hi>They are teachers of Lyes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But they reply that in theſe places the Images of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens <note place="margin">Not only Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Gods for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.</note> are condemned, but they make and worſhip onely jma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the true God and ſaints. I anſwere that as in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement all manner of ſimilitudes are forbidden, ſo prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally Images of the true <hi>Iehouah,</hi> as the Law-giuer doth <note place="margin">Deut. 4. 12. Eſay. 40. 18. Act. 17. 29. Rom. 1. 23.</note> expound himſelfe in many places. Deut. 4. 12. 15. Eſay. 40 18 to 26. Act. 17. 29. Rom. 1. 23. For what greater diſhonor
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:10737:285"/> can be offered vnto God, then to repreſent him who is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Majeſtie, by a baſe viſible Creature, and to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe him in a little Image, who is infinite and incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible?</p>
               <p>Secondly, they object the Cherubins which couered the <note place="margin">The Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins braſen &amp; ſerpent no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Images.</note> Mercy ſeate, and the braſen Serpent. To which I anſwere, that both the one and the other make againſt them, for they were both made by Gods expreſſe Commaundement, but they make Images, which in his Law are expreſly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and condemned. The Cherubins were made not to be worſhipped, but to couer the mercy ſeate, that when the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God appeared, men might be kept from curious pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his ſecrets, and that ſeeing no manner of ſimilitude they might make no reſemblance of him. And the braſen Serpent was not erected that the people ſhould worſhip it, but that it ſhould be a figure and type of Chriſt, &amp; a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their curing and healing, not onely in reſpect of the wounds which the fiery Serpents made in their bodies, but of thoſe ſpirituall wounds which the old Serpent Sathan had made both in body and ſoule by the ſting of ſin. And when the people did alter the end and vſe thereof, and abuſed it vnto Idolatry, <hi>Ezekias</hi> in zeale to Gods glory did breake it in peeces. 1 King. 18. 4. <note place="margin">King. 18. 4.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And thus they object for their making of Images: now <note place="margin">The popiſh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges anſwered.</note> for their worſhipping of them, which is the groſeſt kinde of Idolatry, and ſo extreamely repugnant to the word of God; they alledge in their excuſe that they doe not worſhip the Images themſelues, but onely ſo far forth as they haue rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the things wherof they are Images. To which I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, that this excuſe is both falſe and vaine: the falſhood of their doctrine appeareth by their practiſe, for if they did not worſhip the images themſelues, to what purpoſe did they by their deuices giue vnto them a ſeeming life and motion, as the turning of the eies, the mouing of the hands, and the bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the head and body, and why was one Image had in great eſteeme, &amp; another image of the ſame Saint negiected and diſregarded?</p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:10737:286"/>
               <p> Secondly, their excuſe is vaine, ſeeing this is that Idolatry which is ſo much condemned in the Scriptures: for the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites when they worſhipped Images, did profeſſe that they did not worſhip the Idols of wood and ſtone, but God in them; ſo when they made a golden Calfe in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they had therein a reſpect to God, who brought them out of the land of Aegypt, and profeſſed that in it they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the true <hi>Iehouah,</hi> as appeareth. Exod. 32. 4. 5. So <note place="margin">Exod. 32. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Micah</hi> his mother ſaith, that ſhee had dedicated the <hi>ſiluer vnto the Lord, to make a grauen and moulten Image.</hi> Iud. 17. 3. <note place="margin">Iudg. 17. 3.</note> So <hi>Ieroboam</hi> hauing made the golden Calues, ſaith: <hi>behold O Iſraell thy Gods which brought thee out of the land of Aegipt:</hi> 1 King. 12. 28. that is, the Image and ſimilitude which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenteth <note place="margin">1 King. 12. 28.</note> the true God: neither would any haue beene ſo ſottiſh as to beleeue that the Calues which themſelues had lately made, had freed their fore-fathers out of their capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitie. And as we haue heard the people worſhipped not the Image of <hi>Baal,</hi> but God in the Image: and therefore the Lord ſaith, they ſhould no more call him <hi>Baali.</hi> Chap. 2. ver. <note place="margin">Hoſ. 2. 16.</note> 16. Yea euen the heathens themſelues thus excuſed their I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie, as <hi>Auſtine</hi> witneſſeth: <hi>Non ego illum lapidem colo</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In Pſal. 96.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; adoro quem video, ſed ſeruio ei quem non video. Quis eſt ille?

And who is hee? a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine inviſible and Diuine power which hath the charge of that Image.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this Doctrine is, firſt that we laude and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <note place="margin">We muſt laud Gods name for freeing vs from popiſh idolatry</note> the name of our gracious God, who hath freed vs from this more then Aegyptian darkneſſe of Idolatry and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and hath placed vs in his Goſhen and true Church, where by the cleare ſhining light of his Goſpell he hath diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled theſe foggy miſts of ſottiſh ignorance, and hath plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcouered euen to the eyes of little children thoſe doltiſh follies, with which the wiſeſt of their fore-fathers were blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and miſllead.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſerueth to admoniſh vs, that we doe not with
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:10737:286"/> the vnthankfull Iſraelits deſire to returne againe into this <note place="margin">We muſt not deſire to return into this Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh ſeruitude.</note> Egyptian ſeruitude, becauſe we would injoy thoſe pompous pleaſures which the aduocates of Rome doe offer vnto vs, but that we rather make choiſe of the afflicted way of gods truth, which wil in the end bring vs to the heauenly Canaan. And to this purpoſe we muſt auoide not onely the groſeſt kindes of Idolatrie and ſuperſtition, but alſo all the pettite ſorts therof, yea we muſt carefully flye the meanes of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, as will-worſhip, ſociety with Idolaters, eſpecially in that neere bond of mariage, ignorance of Gods true religion, whereby wee make our ſelues like blind men, which may eaſilie be led any way, and as it were an eaſie pray to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured of thoſe locuſts, the Prieſts, and Ieſuits, which are come out of the bottomeleſſe pit.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we are hereby admoniſhed to imbrace and loue <note place="margin">We muſt loue Gods truth if we would not be ſeduced with Papiſts deluſions.</note> the truth, which the Lord by the Miniſters of his word hath in ſuch plentifull manner and meaſure deliuered vnto vs, leaſt for the contempt of his Goſpell, he giue vs ouer to ſtrong deluſions, and to beleeue lyes; which ſeduction is a certaine forerunner of eternall condemnation, as the Apoſtle ſheweth 2 Theſ. 2. 11. 12. And whileſt we make profeſsion of the <note place="margin">2.

               <p>The third thing to be obſerued is, that the Lord condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <note place="margin">That it is an haynous ſinne to vſe diuinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> it as an haynous ſinne, to conſult with idols, and to vſe diuination for direction in time of daunger, or for knowledge of future things, which are contingent.

               <p>The vſe hereof ſerueth to reproue many amongſt vs, who when either themſelues or their friends be ſicke, or when they haue loſt their goods by theeues or other caſualties, or when they curiouſly deſire to know what ſhall befall them in the time to come, are ready to vſe theſe wicked and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolicall meanes for the ſatisfying of their deſires; wherein they bewray notable diffidence, impietie, &amp; folly: diffidence, in that if the Lord defer his helpe a little while, they will not
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:10737:287"/> waite his leaſure, nor truſt in his promiſes, but rather relye vpon the diuell, and vpon the direction of his wicked inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Their impietie is hereby manifeſted, in that they ſeeke to free themſelues from thoſe afflictions which God hath laid vpon them by Sathans helpe, (as it were) whether God will or no, for if it were his will they ſhould be releaſed, he would graunt them lawfull meanes. Laſtly, they ſhew their folly, not onely in that they inquire <hi>of them who haue a ſpirit of diuination, and of the Southſayers who murmure and whiſper,</hi> and leaue the Lord moſt wiſe and moſt mighty, <hi>and goe from the liuing to the dead;</hi> contrary to, the admonition of the Prophet, Eſay. 8. 19. but alſo in that they imagine they <note place="margin">Eſa. 8. 19.</note> can preuaile againſt God by Sathans aſsiſtance, who is but his ſlaue, and ſo faſt tyed in chaynes, that he is not able to ſtir without his permiſsion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we here learne what is the cauſe why Idolaters, <note place="margin">The cauſe why the wiſeſt Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters liue in ſottiſh ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions.</note> who otherwiſe are exceeding wiſe, doe liue in moſt ſottiſh ſuperſtition, and are blinded with ſuch childiſh follies as may moue in any juſt cauſe of admiration; namely, becauſe they are ſeduced with a ſpirit of fornications, that is, not onely abandoned of Gods ſpirit, who leadeth vs into all truth, but alſo wholy lead with the vncleane ſpirit Sathan, the chiefe author of ſpirituall whoredome, who begetteth in theſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of diſobedience a ſpirit of Idolatry, that is, a vehement and earneſt deſire to liue in this ſinne; with which they are ſo wholy tranſported, that they goe forward in their groſſe and abſurd courſes, not onely againſt religion, and the reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will of God, but againſt reaſon, nature, and common ſenſe. An example hereof wee haue in the Iſraelites, who howſoeuer they had ſo manifold experience of Gods mercy and power, in multiplying his benefits vpon them, and in their miraculous deliuerances, &amp; preſeruation from their eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and of his ſeuere juſtice in puniſhing their Idolatries, yet were ſo ſeduced with this ſpirit of fornications, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gods mercyes nor judgements could reſtraine them from forſaking his true worſhip, and ſeruing the Idols of the Heathens, in as groſe manner as thoſe who neuer heard of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:10737:288"/> God and his word. The like experience we haue in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts at this day, who howſoeuer they are worldly wiſe, in the things of this life, yet being bewitched and carried headlong with this ſpirit of fornications, they ſuffer themſelues witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and willingly to be abuſed by their falſe teachers, as if they were the moſt ignorant ideots in the world; they beleeue the carnall preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament of the aulter, contrarie not onely to religion but alſo to reaſon, nature, and their owne ſenſe, and adore their breaden God with diuine worſhip; they are content with great ſummes of money to purchaſe pardon of their ſinnes of the Pope, who is a ſinfull man like themſelues, yea the man of ſinne; they whip and torment themſelues before their idolls like <hi>Baalls</hi> Prieſts; they creepe to the Croſſe; and goe on pilgrimage to images of wood and ſtone, and by praying, vowing, and offering vnto them, they acknowledge them as their Gods, ſeeing they giue vnto them all parts of diuine worſhip, whereas they are creatures more baſe and impotent then themſelues; and whence proceedeth all this but that they are giuen ouer of God to ſtrong deluſions, and to beleeue lyes, bewitched of the euill ſpirit ſathan, and wholy tranſported and miſlead with the ſpirit of fornications.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is, that howſoeuer we are ſometime led <note place="margin">We muſt take heed we be not tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the ſpirit of ſinne.</note> captiue of ſinne, and through infirmitie be ouertaken with the corruption of the fleſh, yet that we carefully take heede we be not tranſported wholy with the ſpirit of ſinne, deſiring to breake Gods commandements, &amp; delighting in our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsion.

               <p>Fiftly, we here learne that as ſoone as men addict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues <note place="margin">They that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict themſelues to idolatrie ſhake of Gods yoke.</note> to wil-worſhip, ſuperſtition, and idolatrie, they ſhake off Gods yoke, and withdraw themſelues from vnder his gouernment; as the Iſraelits in this place, who when they went a whoring after their idols, are ſaide to haue departed from vnder their God. So Deu. 31. 16. <hi>They will goe a whoring</hi>

               <p>The reaſon is manifeſt, for they who refuſe to be gouerned by the kings law, and either make their owne will a law, or ſubmit themſelues to be ruled by the law of a ſtrange Prince, they doe not onely reject the law but alſo refuſe to haue that Prince for their gouernour; but the word of God, is his law and the ſcepter of his kingdome, whereby he ruleth all his ſubjects, and therefore they who will not be ruled by this law, but by their owne will, and humaine inuentions and traditions, in refuſing Gods law they refuſe and forſake God himſelfe, and will not admit him for their gouernour. And hence it is that the Lord joyned theſe together, where he ſaith, that <hi>Saul</hi> had forſaken him &amp; had not performed his commandements, 1 Sam. 15. 11. and 1 King. 11. 33, <hi>Becauſe</hi>

               <p>The vſe hereof is, that we moſt carefully avoide all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Idolatry, Superſtition, and will-worſhip, and not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our ſelues with a conceipt that the Lord will be content with our devotion and good meaning, though it diſſent from his word, that we may proſtrate our bodie vnto an image, and reſerue our hearts for God, and that his will &amp; our owne wils, his Law and humane inventions may well ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in his worſhip and ſeruice; for God and Idols, the Ark and <hi>Dagon,</hi> light and darkneſſe, righteouſneſſe and vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, true religion and ſottiſh ſuperſtition, will neuer agree together, but as ſoone as we receiue the one, we doe <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> exclude and forſake the other, and therefore wee are put to our choiſe, whether wee will forſake the true <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houah,</hi> or the Idoll <hi>Baal,</hi> Gods true religion, or our owne Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtions.</p>

               <p>But they neglected the commaundements of God, and erected altars, and offred ſacrifices vpon the hils and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines; imitating therein the heatheniſh Gentiles, who erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Temples in woods and groues vpon the tops of hils, according to that:</p>

               <p>Whereof alſo their Temples were called <hi>Phana,</hi> becauſe in reſpect of their high ſituation they were eminent and conſpicuous; to which they were moued by theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe being more ſtately &amp; majeſticall, they thought
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:10737:290"/> them more fit for diuine worſhip, and alſo becauſe they thought theſe places in regard of their eminencie nearer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen, which is the place of Gods chiefe reſidence, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they preferred heatheniſh wil-worſhip and their owne naturall reaſon before the expreſſe word of God.</p>
               <p>And this was that idolatrous ſuperſtition, which is ſo often condemned in the bookes of the Kings &amp; Chronicles; namely, that they did worſhip in the groues and high places, yea &amp; kings otherwiſe godly &amp; religious, are blemiſhed with this note of diſgrace, that they ſuffred ſuch kinde of worſhip, and did not cut downe the groues, and vtterly demoliſh theſe idolatrous places. Thus <hi>Salomon</hi> ſinned in erecting an high place for <hi>Chemoſh</hi> the abhomination of <hi>Moab,</hi> in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, &amp;c. as appeareth 1 King. 11. 7.

               <p>It is further added by way of more particular deſcription that they burned incenſe vpon the hils, vnder the Oakes, &amp; the Poplar tree, and the Elme; and the reaſon mouing them therevnto is adjoyned, becauſe the ſhadow therof was good, the meaning is that they ſacrificed and burnt incenſe in their groues, and made choyſe for this purpoſe of ſuch trees, as were moſt pleaſant, and by reaſon of their broad and thick leaues, moſt fit to caſt a delightful ſhadow, which would not onely ſhelter them from the ſchorching heat of the Sun, but alſo ſtirre vp in them a kind of ſuperſtitious deuotion. The which alſo was increaſed by a conceit which they had of the trees themſelues; for as they put more holyneſſe in the hils then in the vallies, ſo alſo in one tree more then in another, in reſpect of the diuers idols, vnto which they were conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, according to that:</p>
               <q>

               </q>
               <p>That is, the Poplar tree is moſt acceptable to <hi>Hercules,</hi> the Vine to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> the Myrrhe tree to <hi>Venus,</hi> and the Bay tree to <hi>Apollo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereby the Prophet ſheweth, that they were vtterly
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:10737:290"/> fallen away from the true religion to Paganiſme and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh ſuperſtition and idolatry; for which ſinnes they were much more vnexcuſable, both becauſe for them principally the Lord had caſt out the nations before them, and alſo had giuen them expreſſe and ſtraight commandement, that they ſhould vtterly demoliſh and deface all theſe idolatrous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, deſtroy the places wherein the nations ſerued their Gods, vpon the high Mountaines, and vpon the hils, and vnder euery greene tree, and ouerthrow their aulters, and breake downe their pillars, and burne their groues, hew downe the grauen images of their Gods, and aboliſh their names out of the place, Deut. 12. 2. 3. and 7. 4. 5. <note place="margin">Deut. 12. 2. 3. and 7. 4. 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>So that they could not pretend ignorance for their excuſe, being ſufficiently inſtructed both by Gods workes and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by his word, and therefore it is manifeſt, that being who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried away with a ſpirit of fornications they committed theſe ſinnes proudly and preſumptuouſly againſt Gods Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, preferring humane inuentions and their owne ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions before Gods reuealed will.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe ſome colour of excuſe they had to blinde their owne judgements, gagge their conſciences, and to ſtop the mouthes of all reprouers, namely, becauſe the ſhadow of theſe groues and trees was good, that is, both pleaſant and profitable; pleaſant both in reſpect of the delightfull ſhade, and the ſweetneſſe of the aire, which vſually accompanyeth ſuch places, and profitable not onely for the inlarging their deuotions, but becauſe they were thereby alſo preſerued from the ſcorching heat of the ſunne, with which the people of thoſe countries were ſometimes moleſted, and ſo fitted as they thought with more alacritrie to performe their reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſeruices.</p>
               <p>So that the cauſe why they tranſgreſſed Gods commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement was as it ſeemeth their good meaning, whereby they imagined that by taking their owne courſes, they ſhould be much better fitted for his ſeruice, then by following his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in his word; which in truth was nothing els but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and abhominable pride in them, whereby they thought
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:10737:291"/> themſelues wiſer then God himſelfe, and preferred their own wil-worſhip and humaine inventions, before Gods reuealed will.</p>
               <p>And thus haue we ſeene what their ſinne was, as it is here plainly expreſſed; the which alſo in the ſame words is much aggrauated: firſt, in that they did not onely ſeldome fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ſinne, but made it an vſuall and common practiſe, &amp; this is ſignified by the Verbe here vſed in the original, which being in the ſecond Conjugation of Actiues, doth imply the frequency of the action, as <hi>Tremelius</hi> obſerueth; as alſo where he ſaith, that they ſacrificed on the mountaines and hils, in the plurall number, and vnder the Oke, Popler, and Elme, whereby he intimateth that the Iſraelites were not contented to commit this Idolatry in one or two places, or vpon ſome few Altars, but they had many hils, many groues, many Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, &amp; many Chappels and Temples, which they had erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in euery part of the Land. Wherein it ſeemeth they glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed as though they were in better caſe, and much to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the Iewes, ſeeing they had but one Temple, &amp; one Altar for ſacrifices, and another for ſweet incenſe, where as they had great varietie and choiſe of Temples and Alters for their deuotions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, their ſinne was aggrauated by their ſhameleſſe impudencie, for they did not commit their ſpirituall whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes in ſecret corners, but in the eye of the world in moſt eminent places.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, in that they were not abaſhed at their wickednes, but rather juſtified it by pretending their good meaning, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancing themſelues before all who had not aſpired to the ſame degree of ſinne, and that through affected and wilfull ignorance, for their practiſe was repugnant and oppoſite to the expreſſe word of God, which was not onely committed vnto them in writing, but alſo faithfully expounded and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly inforced by Gods true Prophets.</p>
               <p>And this was the peoples ſinne: their puniſhment fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, whereof there is two degrees: the firſt, that he would puniſh them in their familie with ſhame and reproach: the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:10737:291"/> ſecond, that he would with-hold the meanes, with which ſuch abuſes ſhould bee reformed, whereby they were diſcredited and diſgraced. The firſt is contayned in theſe words, <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Daughters ſhall be harlots, and your Spouſes ſhall be Whores.</hi> The which words ſome vnderſtand as the fruit and effect of their Idolatry, both becauſe ſpirituall whoredome is vſually finiſhed and perfected with corporall adultery, as appeareth in the example of the children of Iſraell, ſeduced by the daughters of <hi>Moab:</hi> Num. 25. 1. 2. 6. and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">Num. 25. 1. 2. 6</note> husbands and fathers gaue their wiues and daughters fit occaſion and opportunitie to play the harlots, whileſt they abſented themſelues in the hils and groues about their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious deuotions, yea, and prouoked them alſo by their bad example, when vnder colour of Religion they gaue themſelues to all vncleanneſſe, as it is the vſuall practiſe of Idolaters.</p>
               <p>But I rather expound theſe words, as the puniſhment the Lord threatneth to inflict vpon them for their Idolatry; namely, that he would puniſh their ſpirituall whoredome with carnall whoredome, and becauſe by their frequent Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries, they had grieuouſly diſhonoured his name, therefore hee would diſgrace and diſhonour them, by cauſing their houſes to become ſtewes, and their daughters and ſpouſes, or daughters in Law (as the word may indifferently ſignifie) to become ſtrumpets and common harlots. The which puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Lord inflicted vpon the Gentiles, who becauſe <hi>they turned the glory of the incorruptible God, into the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the image of a corruptible man, and of birds,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God gaue them vp to their owne harts luſts, vnto vncleannes</hi>

                  <hi>and to defile their owne bodyes amongſt themſelues,</hi> &amp;c. as it is, Rom. 1. 23. 24. Where we are to obſerue that the Lord pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth one ſinne with another, not by infuſing corruption, or by prouoking vnto wickedneſſe, but onely by with draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his grace, and by giuing men ouer to their owne vile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p>Now this puniſhment by the Law of requitall, is proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onated vnto their ſin, for as the Idolaters did rob God of his
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:10737:292"/> honour to giue it vnto Idols, ſo the Lord threatneth to ſpoile them of their honours, and to expoſe their names to infamie <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 13.</note> and reproach, by ſuffering their wiues and daughters to play the Harlots; and becauſe being his ſpouſe and children they proſtituted themſelues to idols, and exceedingly grieued him by their Adulteries, therefore hee would vexe them alſo, by ſuffering their wiues and children to defile themſelues with Adulterers, that ſo by their owne griefe, they might learne how much they had grieued the Lord with their ſpirituall fornications.</p>
               <p>Whereby the Lord ſheweth, that in the day of his viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hee needeth not to ſeeke farre for meanes of reuenge, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he could make them their owne executioners, and their neareſt and deareſt friends the inſtruments of his wrath, to inflict on them deſerued puniſhents.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of the words. The doctrines <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The doctrines. </seg>
                  </label> which ariſe out of them are theſe. Firſt, we may obſerue that <note place="margin">God as well condemneth Idolatrous ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies as I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</note> the Lord condemneth it as a great ſin, not onely when men ſerue him with a falſe and Idolatrous worſhip, but alſo when the manner, Ceremonies, and circumſtances are repugnant vnto his word So the Iſraelites are here accuſed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, not onely for their wil-worſhip and ſuperſtition in the ſeruice of God it ſelfe, but alſo becauſe they failed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the place; for whereas God had ſtraightly charged them, that they ſhould publikely worſhip him, by ſacrifices and oblations in his Tabernacle and Temple onely, they contrariwiſe erected Alters and offred ſacrifices vpon the hils and mountaines. So <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> were preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Leu. 10.</note> conſumed with fire which came out from God, becauſe they offred ſtrange fire, though they worſhipped the true God, and that in other reſpects, with ſuch ſeruice as hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. Thus <hi>Saul</hi> was rejected, and <hi>Vzziah</hi> was ſmitten with <note place="margin">2 Chro. 26. 18. 19.</note> the Leproſie, becauſe they vſurped the Prieſts office.</p>
               <p>The reaſon whereof is this, becauſe the Lord is author of that commandement which concerneth the circumſtance, as well as of that which concerneth the ſubſtance, and is no leſſe diſobeyed in the one then in the other. Neyther doth the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:10737:292"/> Lord ſo much reſpect the matter, or object of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresſion where about it is made, as the minde of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſour, and the neglect, or contempt of his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For example in the ſinne of our firſt parents, he did not reſpect the eating of the Apple, but their diſobedience to his precept, their pride, infidelitie and rebellion. Hee did not regard the gathering of ſticks on the Sabbath day, but the contemptuous breach of his commandement, which he had publiſhed immediately before. In a word, all the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the law were in themſelues matters of no ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, but foraſmuch as the Lord had commaunded ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall duties, as well as morall, and exerciſed the Churches obedience in them both, therefore it was a great ſin to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the ceremonies and cerimoniall worſhip, becauſe the commaundement of God was tranſgreſſed herein, as well as in the neglect of morall duties. And this is that which <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muell</hi> told <hi>Saul,</hi> when he laboured to extenuate his ſinne, that <hi>diſobedience was as the ſin of witchcraft, and to tranſgreſſe Gods expreſſe commandement</hi> wilfully though in a ſmal matter, was <hi>as Idolatry in his ſight.</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 23. <note place="margin">1. Sam. 15. 23</note>
               </p>
               <p>The vſe hereof ſerueth to teach vs, that we ſubmit our ſelues to be ruled by the preſcript rule of Gods word, as in all our actions, ſo eſpecially in performing the duties of his worſhip and ſeruice, neither declining vnto the right hand nor to the left; for to doe more then he requireth is ſuperſtition, and to doe leſſe, profaneneſſe. As therefore it was a ſinne in the old Law, to offer ſacrifice in any other place but in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, becauſe God had reſtayned his publike ſeruice to that place alone; ſo it is a ſin of ſuperſtition in the time of the Goſpell, to put more holineſſe in one Chruch then in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſeeing now Chriſt hath abrogated the ceremonies of the Law, and made all places alike, requiring this alone of vs, that <hi>in euery place we lift vp pure hands, and worſhip God in ſpirit and truth,</hi> as it is, Iohn. 4. 23. 24. <note place="margin">Iohn 4. 23. 24.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And as they ſuperſtitiouſly ſinne, which put difference in places dedicated to Gods publike worſhip and ſeruice, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his word he hath taken ſuch differences away, ſo they
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:10737:293"/> likewiſe offend, who confound publike &amp; priuate worſhip, together with the places allotted to either of them, becauſe god in the ſcriptures hath diſtinguiſhed them. For example, when God requireth publike worſhip on his ſabbaths in the aſſemblies and congregation, it is a ſinne for any man to neglect this, though he offer vnto God his priuate ſeruice at home by reading and praying. So whereas God in his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ſeruice requireth vnanimitie and vniformitie, it is a ſinne for any in the aſſemblie to diſtract himſelfe from the reſt, and to make a rent in theſe holy exerciſes; as to reade pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately when the Miniſter with the congregation prayeth publikely, or to pray when he preacheth. For if it be an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd kinde of vnmanerlineſſe, to ſpeake to our better whilſt he ſpeaketh vnto vs, becauſe ſuch confuſion hindreth both our hearing and vnderſtanding, or whilſt he conferreth with vs about important affaires, to turne from him &amp; talke with another; then is it no leſſe abſurditie to ſpeake vnto God in prayer, whilſt he ſpeaketh vnto vs in the Miniſterie of the Word, or when hee dealeth with vs about buſineſſes of no leſſe moment then the ſaluation of our ſoules, to turne from him and giue our ſelues to priuate reading.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we are taught hereby not to extenuate our ſins, <note place="margin">The maine euill in ſinne is the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> by alleadging that the things wherein we offend are but trifles, and matters of ſmall moment; for the maine euill in ſin is the tranſgreſsion of Gods commandement, &amp; the euill diſpoſition of the ſinner. Now Gods commandement is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in ſmall matters, as well as in great, and a man may ſhew more malice and wickednes in committing a ſinne but light in it owne nature, when as it is committed vpon knowledge, againſt the conſcience, preſumptuouſly, &amp; contemptuouſly againſt Gods majeſtie, then another who falleth into a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſinne which is not aggrauated by theſe circumſtances. What ſmaller matter in it ſelfe then to eate an apple? yet here in our firſt parents did grieuouſly ſinne, becauſe they tranſgreſſed Gods expreſſe commandement, and ſhewed groſe infidelitie and pride in this action. What leſſe matter then to gather a few ſtickes vpon the ſabbath day? yet<note place="margin">Num. 15. 32.</note>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:10737:293"/> becauſe it was an action of contempt againſt Gods majeſty, who in his law had newly forbidden it, it was a more hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſinne in Gods ſight, then <hi>Dauids</hi> murther &amp; adultery, becauſe the one proceeded from malice of hart and profane deſpite of God, the other from the frailtie and infirmitie of the fleſh.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be obſerued, is the ſpreading leproſie <note place="margin">The ſpreading leproſie of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie.</note> of idolatrie, which if it once haue infected vs, though it ſeeme but a ſmall ſpecke or ſpot at the firſt, it will in ſhort time ouer ſpread the whole bodie. At the firſt through <hi>Ieroboams</hi> inſtigation the Iſraelits erected Idols but in two places of the land, namely Dan and Bethell, but as we ſee, it ſo increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a ſmall time that idols were erected and worſhipped almoſt in euery hill and mountaine, and vnder euery greene tree, as appeareth in this place. The like example we haue in the papiſts at this day; in former times they onely erected images in Churches, to put them in mind of Chriſt, and of the Saints, but when they had thus farre tranſgreſſed Gods commandement by their will-worſhip, they did not ſtay here, but haue alſo giuen vnto them diuine worſhip, &amp; haue multiplyed their idols and images in number farre aboue any heathens and pagans; the cauſe hereof is, the corruption of mans nature, which is exceedingly addicted to this idolatrie and ſuperſtition, partly through groſeneſſe of vnderſtanding, affecting a palpable deitie and diuine worſhip, which is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the ſenſes, and partly through pride, preferring his owne inuentions and wil-worſhip, before the will of God reuealed in his word.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is, that we doe not onely flee from idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie <note place="margin">We muſt flye the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie.</note> in the groſeſt kinde, but alſo that wee ſhunne the firſt beginnings thereof, for if in the leaſt degree we giue way vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, we ſhall from one degree aſcend vnto another, till we come to the higheſt; partly becauſe we are naturally poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a ſpirit of fornications, which carrieth vs headlong into this ſin, and partly becauſe the Lord will giue vs vp to a reprobate ſenſe, and to be deluded with ſtrong deluſions, if wee doe not imbrace and loue his truth, but incline to
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:10737:294"/> wil-worſhip and Idolatry.</p>
               <p>The third thing to be obſerued is, that our good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">Good intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons hauing no ſound ground no better then wil-worſhip</note> in Gods ſeruice, which haue no ground in his word, are nothing elſe but wil-worſhip and ſuperſtition. The Iſraelites made choyſe to worſhip in the groues and vnder the greene trees, becauſe the ſhadow thereof was good, that is, becauſe they thought theſe pleaſant places and delightfull ſhade in the ſweet and open ayre, were moſt fit and conuenient for religious worſhip: but becauſe this their good intention was contrary to Gods word, which reſtrayned publike ſeruice &amp; ſacrifices vnto the Temple at Ieruſalem, their good mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing could not priuiledge them from the juſt cenſure of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie and Superſtition. So <hi>Aaron</hi> in a good intention made <note place="margin">Exod. 32. 1. 5.</note> a golden calfe. Exod. 32. 1. 5. But it was condemned and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed as groſe Idolatry. <hi>Gedeon</hi> in a good intention made <note place="margin">Iudg. 8. 27.</note> an Ephod of the Midianitiſh pray, but it was an occaſion of Idolatry, and the ruine of his houſe; and <hi>Micahs</hi> mother in a good intention made a moulten Image, Iudg. 17. 3. and <note place="margin">Iudg. 17. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Micah</hi> himſelfe conſecrated one of his ſonnes to be a prieſt vnto it, Verſe. 5. and entertained a Leuite for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, with the like good meaning, and yet neuertheleſſe all this was but groſe ſuperſtition and Idolatry in Gods ſight.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is, that we be not deluded with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt, that the Lord will accept of any manner of ſeruice, ſo it proceed from a good meaning &amp; intention, for if it haue no warrant out of Gods Word, but bee repugnant therevnto, vvhatſoeuer our meaning and intention bee, it is but vvil-worſhip, ſuperſtition and Idolatry in Gods ſight. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt not examine what we intend, but what God requireth; not what we like as moſt fit and couenient, but what is pleaſing vnto God. And this examination is to be made not according to our owne phantaſies and carnall wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which as the Apoſtle ſaith, is emnitie againſt God, but <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 7.</note> according to the canon and rule of Gods word, which that we may the rather doe, let theſe reaſons perſwade vs: firſt, becauſe the Lord hath ſtraightly forbidden and condemned all manner of vvil-worſhip, and in his ſeruice hath preciſely
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:10737:294"/> reſtrayned vs to his word for our direction. Deu. 5. 32. <hi>Take</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 5. 32. and 12. 8. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>heed that you doe as the Lord your God hath commanded, turne not aſide to the right hand nor to the left,</hi> And 12. 8. <hi>Yee ſhall not doe after all theſe things, that we doe here this day,</hi> that is, <hi>euery man what ſeemeth him good in his owne eyes.</hi> And Verſ. 32. <hi>Whatſoeuer I command you, take heede you doe it, thou ſhalt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Num. 15. 39. Prou. 39. 5. 6. Ezech. 20. 18. Col. 2. 20. The cauſes why the Lord forbiddeth all wil-worſhip.</note> 
                  <hi>put nothing thereto nor take ought there from.</hi> So Numb. 15. 39 Pro. 30. 5. 6. Ezech. 20. 18. Col. 2. 20.</p>
               <p>Now the cauſes why the Lord doth ſo earneſtly forbid all manner of vvil-worſhip, are principally two: firſt, it doth exceedingly derogate from his wiſedome, when as men doe not think his lawes ſufficient for their gouernment &amp; directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but labour to perfect them by their owne inventions, as though they were wiſer then God himſelfe. Now if it be an odious thing to an earthly prince that his ſubjects ſhould take vpon them to alter, or adde, or detract from his Lawes, or in ſtead of ſubmitting themſelues to be gouerned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, ſhould make their owne vvill a law, though they ſhould make neuer ſo faire a ſhew of their good meaning &amp; inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; then how odious and abhorninable a thing is it for vs, thus to demeane our ſelues towards God who is infinite in wiſedome, and the ſupreame king of heauen and earth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe where wil-worſhip and humane inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <note place="margin">Wil-worſhip baniſheth the true ſeruice of God.</note> are intertayned, there ſoone after the true worſhip of God is expelled and baniſhed, for ſuch is the averſeneſſe of mans corrupt nature towards the true worſhip of God, and proanneſſe vnto humane inventions and ſuperſtitions, that when they are both together, he nouriſheth and maketh high eſteeme of wil-worſhip, as being the birth of his owne brain, and vtterly neglecteth Gods pure and ſincere ſeruice, which in his word he hath preſcribed, as though it were the child of a ſtranger. And this is a notable fruit of pride and ſelfe loue, when as men preferre the wiſedome of the fleſh before the wiſedome of God, and their owne inventious before his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements. The which was the ſinne of the Scribes and Phariſies, who as our Sauiour charged them, made the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God of no authority, whileſt they eſtabliſhed
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:10737:295"/> their owne traditions. Mat. 15. 16. And vvhileſt they vvere <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 16. and 23. 23.</note> ouer buſie in tithing Mint, Annis, and Commin, they were vvholy negligent in the vvaightie matters of Gods Law, as Iudgement, Mercy and Fidelitie, as it is, Mat. 23. 23.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it behoueth vs to imbrace Gods pure and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere <note place="margin">Wil-worſhip is vaine and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable.</note> vvorſhip preſcribed in his vvord, and to auoide vvil-vvorſhip &amp; our owne ſuperſtitious deuotions, becauſe when vve haue ſpent our time and euen tyred our ſelues in theſe things all our labour will bee ſpent in vaine. So the Lord himſelfe ſaith, Mat. 15. 9. <hi>In vaine they worſhip mee, teaching</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat 15. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>for doctrines mens precepts.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main inventions and traditions, <hi>as touch not, taſte not, handle not, doe periſh in the vſing.</hi> Col. 2. 22. For if we would haue <note place="margin">Col. 2. 22.</note> any wages for our labour, vve muſt doe the Lords vvorke vvhich himſelfe hath commaunded, otherwiſe hee vvill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of vs, as hee did of the Iſraelits, Eſay 1 12. <hi>Who hath</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eſay. 1. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>required theſe things at your hands.</hi> And vvill ſay vnto vs, as he did to the Prieſts and people of Iſraell, Zach. 7. 5. <hi>When yee</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Zach. 7. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>faſted and mourned did ye faſt vnto me? did I approue it? and when yee did eate and drinke, did yee not eate and drincke for your ſelues? ſhould ye not heare the words which the Lord hath cryed by the miniſtery of the former Prophets? &amp;c.</hi> The reaſon hereof is plaine, for as the Lord hath appointed vs to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, ſo alſo he hath appointed our way, out of vvhich who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer turneth aſide, the faſter hee goeth the further hee is from the end of his iourney, and ſo ſpendeth his labour not onely in vaine but to loſſe. <hi>This is the way walke in it.</hi> If vve vvould <hi>offer our bodyes a liuing ſacrifice, holy and acceptable vnto God, which is our reaſonable ſeruing of God,</hi> vve muſt not follovv our ovvne inuentions nor humane traditions, but <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to finde out what is the good will of God, acceptable, and perfect,</hi> as it is, Rom. 12. 1. 2. And if vve would doe good <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1. 2.</note> vvorks indeed, vve muſt not follovv our owne phantaſie, but Gods commandements: for vve are <hi>created vnto good works in Chriſt Ieſus, which God hath ordayned that wee ſhould walke in them,</hi> as it is, Eph. 2. 10.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, this may reſtraine vs from Wil-worſhip and <note place="margin">Ephe. 2. 10.</note>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:10737:295"/> ſuperſtition, in that whatſoeuer our good meaning &amp; deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Wil-worſhip is the ſeruice of ſathan, not of God.</note> is, yet in truth whilſt vve offer vnto God ſuperſtitious &amp; idolatrous ſeruice, we doe not worſhip the Lord but ſathan, the vncleane ſpirit, &amp; chiefe author of this ſpirituall whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. So when the Iſraelites vvorſhipped idols, and offred ſacrifices vnto then, howſoeuer they pretended that they vvorſhipped the true <hi>Iehouah</hi> in them, yet the Lord plainely ſaith, that they did not offer vnto God, but vnto diuels. Deut. 32. 17. So Pſal. 106. 37, <hi>They offred their ſonnes and daughters vnto Diuels.</hi> And the Lord plainely ſaith, that <note place="margin">Deut. 32. 17. Pſal. 106. 37.</note> whileſt they worſhipped their images in the wilderneſſe, they did not offer vnto him, whatſoeuer they pretended, as it is, Amos. 5. 25. The reaſon hereof is plaine, for whoſe will <note place="margin">Amos. 5. 25.</note> vve obſerue, them vve obey; and their ſeruants vve are, to whom we yeeld obedience, as the Apoſtle ſheweth, Ro. 6. 16 <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 16.</note> But the vvill of God is, that we ſhould vvorſhip him in ſpirit and truth, according to the preſcript rule of his Word, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſide neither to the right hand nor to the left; the vvill of Sathan is, that either vve doe not vvorſhip God at all, or that we worſhip him vvith our owne wil-vvorſhip &amp; ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious deuotions; and therefore they vvho leaue the ſincere and pure vvorſhip of God, and vvill not obey his reuealed vvill, but ſerue him vvith their owne inuentions &amp; humaine traditions, they may be truely ſaid notwithſtanding their good intentions to vvorſhip the diuell, rather then the true God.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing to be obſerued is, that the Lord doth <note place="margin">God puniſheth one ſinne with another.</note> not onely puniſh ſinne vvith puniſhments properly ſo called, but alſo doth puniſh one ſinne vvith another, not by infuſing vvickedneſſe, or by tempting, that is, alluring or prouoking men vnto ſin, <hi>for God thus tempteth no man,</hi> as it is, Iam. 1. 13. <note place="margin">Iames 1. 13.</note> But by withdrawing his grace, and giuing them ouer to bee miſled by their owne corruption. Thus hee puniſhed <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> with hardnes of hart, not by making it hard but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the oyle of his grace, whereby it ſhould haue beene ſoftened. Thus hee tempted <hi>Dauid</hi> to number the people, 2 Sam. 24. 1. becauſe his wrath was kindled againſt Iſraell <note place="margin">2. Sam. 24. 1.</note>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:10737:296"/> for their ſinnes. Thus he puniſhed the Gentiles Idolatry, by giuing them vp to their own vile affections &amp; to a reprobate ſenſe. Rom. 1. And thus in theſe latter dayes, becauſe men <note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> will not loue and imbrace his truth, he <hi>ſendeth amongeſt them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould beleeue lyes.</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 11. And <note place="margin">2. Theſ. 2. 11.</note> this is the moſt grieuous puniſhment which can be inflicted in this life; for other puniſhments through the bleſsing of God, are vſuall meanes to bring vs vnto him, by true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but when vve are puniſhed by adding ſinne vnto ſin, we doe more and more flye from him. Other puniſhments are ſharp eye ſalues, to make vs ſee our miſery, that vvee may be moued to ſue for Gods mercy, and do make vs loath ſin, when as we feele the ſmart, and ſee the curſed fruite vvhich it bringeth forth; but by this puniſhment mens vnderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are darkned, and their hearts hardened, and their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences ſeared, and ſo multiply their ſinnes, and increaſe in fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full manner the meaſure of their condemnation.</p>
               <p>More particularly vve here learne, that the Lord puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">God puniſheth ſpiritual whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome with corporall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe. Num. 25. 1. 2.</note> ſpirituall whoredome with corporall vncleaneſſe, euen as contrariwiſe he puniſheth carnall adultery vvith ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fornication. Of the former vve haue an Example in this place, and in the Iſraelites, who joyned with the Moabites, firſt in their Idolatry, and then in filthy whoredome. Yea, and in our owne times the Lord puniſheth the ſpirituall forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Whore of Babilon, the Church of Rome, by giuing them vp to vile affections, and to all kindes of abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable filthineſſe, which maketh them infamous through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world. Of the latter wee haue an example in <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> who being vnmeaſurably addicted to the ſin of vnclea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and therefore giuen ouer of God to his owne luſts, was ſeduced by his ſtrange wiues to commit alſo with them ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall whoredome with their Idols.</p>
               <p>The vſe of the generall doctrine is, that we carefully take <note place="margin">That it is a moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when God puniſheth one ſinne with another.</note> heede leaſt vvee ſecurely lie vnder that heauie puniſhment, whereby God puniſheth one ſinne with another; otherwiſe we may eaſily deceiue our ſelues and think our ſtate happy when it is moſt miſerable. When the Lord layeth vpon vs
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:10737:296"/> corporall puniſhments, our very ſenſe and feeling putteth vs in minde of our ſinnes, and with a kinde of vrgent neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie forceth vs to ſue for Gods fauour by vnfayned repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: but for the moſt part we are inſenſible of this heauy puniſhment, through the pleaſing ſweetneſſe of ſinne, and the blindneſſe of our vnderſtanding in ſpirituall things. But the more difficulty there is in the matter, the more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection let vs vſe in watching ouer our ſelues; and when Gods word teacheth vs, that God is juſt in puniſhing of ſin, and our owne conſciences tell vs, that we haue grieuouſly offended; if we haue no ſenſible puniſhments layed vpon vs for our ſinnes, in vvhich we lye vvithout repentance, let vs obſerue, if the Lord doe not puniſh vs by this other way, namely, by giuing vs ouer to ſecurity and hardnes of hart, and to commit ſinne vpon ſin without any remorſe or touch of conſcience.</p>
               <p>Now the beſt meanes to prevent this iudgement is, to make a holy vſe of Gods more gentle chaſtiſements, to be moued thereby vnto true repentance, for vſually the Lord doth not inflict vpon his Church this fearefull puniſhment, till they haue often neglected and diſpiſed his fatherly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, wherby they ſhould haue beene reclaymed. So long as there is any hope of amendement, the Lord vſeth his rod of chaſtiſement, but when they vvill not bee reformed, but deſperately ſinne againſt God, the Lord caſteth his rod aſide, thruſteth them from vnder his diſcipline and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, and ſuffereth them to runne on in their owne vvicked courſes.</p>
               <p>The vſe of the particular doctrine is, that vvee imbrace Gods pure worſhip and ſeruice, and do not defile our ſelues with Idolatry, ſuperſtition, and our owne vvil-worſhip, for if we diſhonour the Lord by our ſpirituall whoredome hee will diſhonour vs by ſuffering thoſe of our familie to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and diſcredit vs by their corporall whoredome. If we vexe and grieue our gracious husbands, by proſtituting our ſoules and bodyes to commit ſpirituall vncleannes with Idols, he wil vexe &amp; grieue vs by ſuffering our wiues &amp; daughters
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:10737:297"/> to become harlots, and by turning our houſes into common ſtewes.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we may here obſerue, that the Lord neuer wanteth <note place="margin">The Lord ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wanteth meanes to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> meanes to execute his judgements; for to ſay nothing of his owne abſolute power, whereby he is able to deſtroy the ſinner with a word of his mouth, he hath whole armies of his creatures readie to be the inſtruments of his wrath. So that when men prouoke his anger, hee cannot onely raiſe their enimies againſt them to bring them to deſtruction, but euen their familiar acquaintance; yea euen the children of their owne body, and their wiues who lye in their boſome are ready to be the executioners of Gods vengeance when he appointeth them. When he meant to bring a judgement vpon the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> he could make the tutors and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerners <note place="margin">2. Kings. 10.</note> of his children, to become their executioners. When he purpoſed to cut off proud <hi>Senacharib,</hi> he could vſe his owne ſonnes <hi>Adramelech</hi> and <hi>Sharezer,</hi> to take away his <note place="margin">2. King. 19. 37.</note> life; and though <hi>Dauid</hi> had had no other enimie which might haue beene Gods ſcourge to correct his ſinne, his owne ſonne <hi>Abſalon</hi> will not be wanting to chaſtiſe him, ſo farre forth as God permitteth; yea if the ſinner had neither friend nor enimie to execute Gods vengeance, he can make them to become their owne executioners, as wee may ſee in the example of <hi>Saul, Achitophel, Iudas, Nero,</hi> and many others.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is, that we doe not by our ſinnes, prouoke God vnto anger, ſeeing wee <hi>are not ſtronger then hee,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh; for beſides his owne ſtrength whereby he <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10. 22.</note> is able to deſtroy vs euerie minute, he hath the helpe of all his creatures, yea he can vſe our owne ſtrength for our vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ouerthrow, and make our beſt patrons and protecters to become our murtherers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſerueth to ſhew the extreame follie of thoſe who labour to pleaſe men more then God, and to hazard the <note place="margin">The folly of thoſe who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to pleaſe men more then God.</note> loſſe of his loue, by committing of ſin againſt their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and conſcience, rather then they will hazard the loſſe of the loue of ſome carnall friends, ſeeing if they had done
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:10737:297"/> that which is vpright in Gods ſight, they ſhould hereby haue ſome aſſurance of Gods loue, who hath the harts of men in his hand, and can make their enimies to become their friends; whereas on the other ſide when they prouoke Gods wrath by their ſinnes, hee can eaſilie make thoſe whom by euill meanes and wicked policies they haue made their friends to become their mortall foes, and the inſtruments of his anger, to take juſt vengeance on them for their ſinnes.</p>

                     <hi>Iunius &amp; Polanus.</hi>
                  </note> of great learning and judgement, doe reade theſe vvordes by way of interrogation thus, <hi>ſhould not I puniſh your daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters becauſe they play the harlots? &amp;c.</hi> as though hee ſhould ſay, I will moſt certainely puniſh them, and I appeale to your owne conſciences whether it be not juſt that they ſhould be puniſhed for their vncleanneſſe. The which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation they imbrace becauſe they thinke that it could <note place="margin">Heb. 13. 4.</note> not ſtand with Gods juſtice to ſuffer their adulteries to goe vnpuniſhed.</p>
               <p>But howſoeuer this expoſition be agreeable with the analogie of faith, and is not contrary to the circumſtances of the place, yet I preferre before it our owne tranſlation; firſt,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:10737:298"/> becauſe it better agreeth with all antiquitie: ſecondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it more fitly accordeth with that vvhich vvent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and that which followeth. For before hee ſayd that hee vvould puniſh the ſpirituall whoredome of the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands and Fathers, with the corporall Adulteries of the Wiues and Daughters; and now hee further ſheweth the meanes whereby hee would inflict this puniſhment; not by infuſing this wickednes into them, or by inclining or vrging them to commit theſe ſinnes, but by not onely with-hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his grace vvhich ſhould ſtay them, and ſo leauing them to their owne naturall corruption, which in it ſelfe was moſt prone to this vncleanneſſe, but alſo by denying to chaſtice and correct them for their ſinnes, whereby they might haue beene reſtrayned or reclaimed from them, the vvhich im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punitie would bee an occaſion through their corruption, to make them more ſecurely to goe forward in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And becauſe it might ſeeme hard that the God of juſtice ſhould, when ſinne abounded, make a non-ſizes, and tollerate ſuch wickedneſſe: hee ſheweth in the next words the cauſe hereof, namely, that hee ſuffered their Wiues and Daughters to liue in whoredome and vncleannes, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee might puniſh vvith reproachfull infamy and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full diſgrace their Husbands and Fathers, becauſe they committed both carnall and ſpirituall vvhoredome againſt him.</p>
               <p>Yea, but howſoeuer it was juſt vvith God to puniſh the ſinnes of the husband and fathers, with the ſins of the wiues and daughters, yet how can this ſtand with his juſtice not to puniſh their ſinnes alſo? I anſwere that we are not to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand theſe words generally and abſolutely, as though he would inflict vpon them no kinde of puniſhment, or at no time viſite them for their ſinnes. For it is ſaid, that <hi>whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers and adulterers God will iudge,</hi> Heb. 13. 14. but more ſpecially, that he would not lay vpon them that kinde of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which is called chaſtiſement and correction, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God reſtraineth his children from ſinne, or reclaymeth them by repentance when as they are fallen into it; and that
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:10737:298"/> hee would not puniſh them as yet, but would ſuffer them to goe on in their ſinnes, vntill thereby hee had puniſhed the ſinnes of their husbands and fathers, and then vvhen the meaſure of both their vvickedneſſe vvas full, he would ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme them all in an vniuerſall deluge of his judgements, both in this life and the life to come.</p>
               <p>And this vvas their puniſhment: now the cauſe is annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>for they ſeparate with Harlots, and ſacrifice with Whores:</hi> which vvords ſome reade alſo with an interogation, and doe expound them thus: <hi>ſhould not I puniſh your daughters becauſe they are harlots? &amp;c. Becauſe they,</hi> that is, their fathers <hi>do ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> that is, make choyſe with their harlots at home of their beſt and fatteſt things, which they may offer vvith their Whores publikely vnder ſhew of religion. But this expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeemeth forced and farre fetched, that the Lord ſhould puniſh the daughters and wiues vvhoredomes, becauſe the fathers and husbands joyned with harlots in their Idolatry, beſides that addition of ſeparating the fatteſt things for Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous ſacrifices, ſtandeth but vpon bare conjecture; to ſay nothing of the interrogation and changing of the naturall ſignification of the particles, where no neceſsity vrgeth and conſtraineth. And therefore I rather chooſe another expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vvhich better agreeth vvith the words of the Text, and with the drift of the Prophet in this place. For vvhereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had ſaid he would not by his puniſhments reſtraine their daughters and wiues from their adulteries, whereby they were vtterly diſgraced, and their houſes made infamous; in theſe words he juſtifieth this his heauy puniſhment, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had juſt cauſe to inflict it. For there was no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why their name and reputation ſhould be in any account with him, ſeeing they themſelues had no regard of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but had ſhamefully diſhonoured his holy name by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an apoſtaſie from him and his true Religion, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting both carnall and ſpirituall whoredome with their louers.</p>
               <p>And this is the generall meaning and maine drift of the Prophet, the which will more euidently appeare in the more
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:10737:299"/> particular examining of the words. Where firſt wee are to note that in this ſpeach there is a change of the perſon, for in the beginning hee ſaid, <hi>your daughters, &amp;c.</hi> In which tenour if hee had proceeded hee ſhould haue added, <hi>for you ſeperate your ſelues, &amp;c.</hi> but he turneth his ſpeach from them and vſeth the third perſon, <hi>for they ſeperate, &amp;c.</hi> the which howſoeuer it is vſuall in the writings of the Prophets, yet it ſeemeth this conuerſion of ſpeach is purpoſely in this place affected; for by turning from them hee ſheweth his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and deteſtation of their ſinne, as though they were ſo defiled with their corporall and ſpirituall whoredomes, that they were not worthy to be ſpoken vnto from the Lord.</p>
               <p>It is further added: <hi>for they ſeperate with harlots, &amp;c.</hi> the originall word <hi>Paradh,</hi> which is heere tranſlated Seperate, is as ſome thinke deriued from <hi>Peredh,</hi> which ſignifieth a Mule, which is ſo named becauſe amongſt all the beaſts they are moſt adultrous and luſtfull, howſoeuer they doe not generate. And therefore <hi>Druſius</hi> thinketh the latine word <hi>diuidunt</hi> moſt fit to expreſſe the meaning of it, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſignifieth the act of vncleannes. So <hi>Plautus in Aulular.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Me tu quidem herclè (dicam palam) non diuides.</q>
               <p>By this phraſe then is ſignified both their ſpirituall and corporall whoredome; their ſpirituall whoredome vvhich is here principally vnderſtood by way of Allegorie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted herein, that they ſeperated and diuided themſelues from the Lord their true husband, by breaking the bond of marriage, forſaking his true religion, and proſtituting themſelues to commit ſpirituall whoredome with their idols. Which ſpirituall fornication well deſerued to be puniſhed with corporall adulterie, that as they diſhonoured God by the one, ſo the Lord ſhould cauſe them to be diſhonoured by the other. Their carnall adulterie by themſelues com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted may here alſo be implyed, as an effect of the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, in which reſpect alſo they made diuers kindes of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration with their harlots. For they ſeparated themſelues from their lawfull wiues, to ioyne with harlots, and ſeparated
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:10737:299"/> their harlots from their Husbands, to ioyne with them, and both together ſeperated themſelues from the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of men, becauſe this vice of whoredome lurketh in corners, and loueth the vayle of night and darkneſſe which hideth from the eyes of men her foule deformitie and vglie filthineſſe.</p>
               <p>And I doe the rather expound theſe words in this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſenſe, both becauſe they may well beare it, and alſo becauſe this ſpirituall and carnall whoredome are ſeldome ſeuered, it being an vſuall paradoxe with idolaters to judge the ſinnes of vncleanneſſe to be veniall, as we may ſee in the example of the Iſraelites in former times, and in the Papiſts at this day, whoſe deuotions and ſuperſtitions are ſo polluted with carnall filthineſſe, that all Chriſtendome doth take knowledge thereof. Now in this reſpect alſo it was juſt with God to puniſh them with the adulteries of their wiues and daughters, for ſeeing they had defiled and deflowred other mens wiues and daughters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was a juſt and proportionable puniſhment, that theirs alſo ſhould grinde vnto other men, as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaketh. <note place="margin">Iob. 31. 9. 10.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Now this their ſinne is more plainely ſignified in the next wordes, where hee ſaith, that <hi>they did ſacrifice with whores:</hi> Where hee ſheweth that as their harts were diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from God, and joyned both with their ſpirituall and carnall louers, ſo they made profeſsion of their apoſtaſie and adulterie in their open practiſe; for as they ſecretly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted carnall whoredome with their ſtrumpets vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of religion and deuotion, ſo they openly joyned with them in their ſpirituall adulterie and idolatrie, by ſacrificing vnto their idols. And here againe I expound the wordes both of corporall and ſpirituall filthineſſe, becauſe as their ſacrificing is expreſſed plainely, and not by Allegorie, ſo wee are to vnderſtand the other word <hi>(their whores)</hi> not by Metaphor, but in it owne ſignification. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as by their ſacrificing is ſignified their ſpirituall whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſo by their ſacrificing with harlots is implyed alſo their carnall vncleanneſſe.</p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:10737:300"/>
               <p> And thus I haue ſhewed both their puniſhment and the cauſe thereof: now in the laſt words is contained a further reaſon, vvhy they ſhould bee thus ſeuerely puniſhed, and then their puniſhment is in ſome generall tearmes repeated and ratified. The reaſon is, becauſe they were a people that did not vnderſtand, that is, a people not onely deſtitute of the knowledge of God and his true Religion, but alſo ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted in their ſuperſtitions, and ſo vvholy poſſeſſed vvith affected ignorance, and vvilfull indocibleneſſe, that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gods Word, nor his vvorks, his mercies nor his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, vvould make them to ſee their ſinnes or bring them to repentance.</p>
               <p>Where hee taketh away an objection, vvhich might bee made by the hipocrites, namely, that it would not ſtand with the juſtice of God to deale ſo ſeuerely vvith the people; for they had a good meaning in all their deuotions, and if they fayled in the manner of vvorſhipping God, it was through ignorance, and therefore to bee excuſed. To which obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, the Prophet ſeemeth to anſwere, that they were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant indeede, and by reaſon hereof they fell into all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſinne, but their ignorance did not excuſe their faults, neyther was it ſelfe to bee excuſed, ſeeing they contemned the meanes of knowledge and remayned ignorant, becauſe they would be ignorant, and affected the darkneſſe of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, more then the light of Gods truth.</p>
               <p>The puniſhment denounced is, that <hi>they ſhall fall;</hi> that is, becauſe they are indocible and will not by any meanes bee informed in the right courſe, therefore the Lord will giue them ouer to their owne blindneſſe of minde, that ſo they may goe on in their ſuperſtition and Idolatryes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine perplexed in their reprobate errours, vntill at length they ſtumble, and fall into the pit of vtter ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of the words: The Doctrines <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The doctrines. </seg>
                  </label> which ariſe out of them are theſe. Firſt, we here learne that it is a fearefull judgement of God vpon eyther a Common
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:10737:300"/> wealth or familie, when as hee ſuffereth ſinne and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <note place="margin">It is a fearefull judgement when God doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine vs from ſinne by his chaſtiſements.</note> to abound, and doth not reſtraine men by his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor reclaime them by his corrections: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe that it is a ſigne of Gods loue and fatherly care ouer thoſe whom hee doth chaſtiſe with manifold afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for their ſinnes, that ſo hee may reclaime them from their euill wayes; whereas if they ſhould flouriſh in their wickedneſſe, it would be a notable meanes to hearten them in their ſinne, and to make them ſecurely to goe forward in their euill courſes, without euer calling themſelues to a rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning.</p>
               <p>And this may appeare both by teſtimonies of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by Examples, and by Reaſon. For the firſt, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſayeth, that <hi>the Lord doth ſuffer with long pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>the veſſels of wrath prepared to deſtruction, to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power knowne,</hi> that is, hee ſuffereth them to goe on in their ſinnes without puniſhment, that when they abuſe his patience and long ſuffering as incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements in their wickedneſſe, hee may haue juſt occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to manifeſt his power and wrath in taking due venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance on them. So when the Iſraelites did goe on in their ſinnes, and would neyther bee reformed by his mercyes, nor his judgements, hee threatneth that hee will correct them no more. Eſay. 1. 5. Wherevpon it would follow, <note place="margin">Eſay. 1. 5.</note> that being left vnto themſelues, they would deſperately and ſecurely liue in ſinne, for when as God doth not viſite men for their ſinnes, they goe forward in them, as though they ſhould neuer bee called to a reckoning, as it appeareth. Eccleſiaſt. 8. 11. <hi>Becauſe ſentence againſt an euill worke is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 8. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>not executed ſpeedely, therefore the heart of the Children of men is fully ſet in them to doe euill.</hi> So the Lord rendreth this reaſon why the people did not reuerence, nor feare him, nor remember him, nor his word, Eſay. 57. 11. <hi>Is it not</hi> (ſaith <note place="margin">Eſay. 57 11.</note> hee) <hi>becauſe I hold my peace, and that of long time, therefore thou feareſt not me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But on the other ſide it is a notable ſigne of Gods mercy <note place="margin">It is an notable ſigne of mercy when God correcteth vs for ſinne.</note> and loue, when as hee croſſeth vs in our wicked courſes,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:10737:301"/> and will not ſuffer vs to proſper in our ſinnes, that being by theſe afflictions diſcouraged in our euill wayes, wee may returne backe, and preuent his heauy judgements by true repentance. To this purpoſe the Apoſtle ſayth, that <hi>when wee are iudged, wee are chaſtened of the Lord, that we ſhould not be condemned with the world,</hi> 1 Corinth. 11. 32. And <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 32.</note> therefore hee maketh it a ſigne of Gods loue, and an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our adoption, when as wee are chaſtened of the <note place="margin">Apoc. 3. 21. Heb. 12. 6. 10. 11.</note> Lord. Hebrew. 12. 6. <hi>Whom the Lord loueth hee chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth euery ſonne whom hee receiueth;</hi> And on the other ſide concludeth, that thoſe who liue in ſinne and are not chaſtiſed they are baſtards, and no ſonnes. For as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punitie cauſeth theſe to goe on in wickedneſſe to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, ſo <hi>affliction</hi> howſoeuer <hi>for the preſent it is not ioyous but grieuous, yet it is profitable, becauſe it helpeth to mortifie our ſinnes, and bringeth forth the quiet fruit of righteouſneſſe vnto them which are thereby exerciſed,</hi> as it is, Hebrewes 12. verſe 10. 11.</p>
               <p>This alſo appeareth by examples. When the Sodomites <note place="margin">The former doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</note> liued in their ſinnes, hee ſuffered them ſtill to injoy their pleaſures and abundance, and neuer reclaymed them from their wickedneſſe by his chaſtiſements, but ſuffered them to continue in their ſinnes till the cry of them aſcended into heauen, and called for that laſt and fearefull venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, whereby they were vtterly deſtroyed. So hee ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Cananites to poſſeſſe that pleaſant land, which flowed with Milke and Honie, in great peace and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, till the meaſure of their ſinnes being full, hee pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out vpon them the full Viols of his Wrath.

               <p> But the caſe of Gods Children and Seruaunts is farre otherwiſe, for vvhen they ſinne the Lord doth chaſtiſe them for their amendment, and will not ſuffer them to goe on in their ſinnes to their deſtruction. Wee read but of one ſinne which <hi>Noah</hi> committed, that is to ſay, his ſinne of drunkenneſſe, and yet the Lord puniſhed it by expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him to the deriſion of his owne wicked ſonne; ſo wee read but of three crimes which holy <hi>Dauid</hi> fell into, though hee were a King expoſed to manifould tentations, his adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie, murther, and pride in numbring the people, and yet the Lord ſuffered none of the three to goe vncorrected, for hee puniſhed his adulterie committed in ſecret with anothers mans wife, by letting his ſonne defile his concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines in the ſight of all the people; his murthering of his ſeruant, with the death of his child, and by not ſuffring the ſword to depart from his houſe, his numbring of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by an exceeding plague and peſtilence; ſo that if <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> a man according to Gods owne hart, doe but ſtep a ſide out of the way of righteouſneſſe, the Lord is readie to whip him into it againe, by the ſcourge of afflictions; and that not for want, but in the abundance of his loue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee ſhould haue no incouragement to goe on in ſinne, which would bring him to deſtruction. And this <hi>Dauid</hi> himſelfe well knew, and therefore ſaith, that <hi>before hee was afflicted hee went aſtray, but being afflicted hee kept Gods word.</hi> Pſal. 119. 67. And therefore hee ſaith, that it was <hi>good for him that hee had beene afflicted, ſeeing hereby hee had</hi>

Hee pronounceth them <hi>bleſſed whom God doth chaſtiſe and teach in his Law.</hi> So the Lord telleth <hi>Dauid</hi> that if his ſonne <hi>Salomon</hi> ſinned hee would <hi>chaſten him with the rod of men, but his mercy ſhould not depart from him,</hi> 2 Sam. 7. 14. giuing vs to vnderſtand that hee will not let his children eſcape <note place="margin">2.

Finally, howſoeuer the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles were ſuffered to goe on in their idolatrie, and to flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in their ſinnes; yet as ſoone as his owne people Iſraell
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:10737:302"/> did leaue his pure worſhip and follow Idols, hee did ſeuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſh them as appeareth, Exod. 32. and in the Hiſtory of the Iudges and Kings. <note place="margin">Exod. 32.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, this appeareth by cleare euidence of reaſon: for <note place="margin">The former doctrine proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by reaſons.</note> as impunitie is a manifeſt ſigne that God giueth men ouer to goe on in their ſinnes to their deſtruction, becauſe he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth them the meanes, whereby they might come to the ſight of their ſinne, and vnto true ſorrow for it; ſo it is a good ſigne that God loueth vs, as his Children, when hee vſeth vs like his Children, that is, correcteth vs for our faults, and affordeth vnto vs the meanes whereby wee may bee reclaymed. Wee are ſo blinded with carnall ſecuritie and ſelfe loue, that wee cannot ſee our tranſgreſsions and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and afflictions are that ſharpe, but yet ſoueraigne water, which helpeth to the recouery of our ſight; when as therefore the Lord denyeth to afflict vs liuing in ſinne, what doth he elſe but leaueth vs to our own naturall blindneſſe, to goe on in our ſins, till we fall into the pit of deſtruction? They are thoſe precious ſalues, which ſerue to draw out the core of our corruptions, and thoſe wholeſome, though vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant potions, whereby wee are purged from our ſinnes; when as therefore the Lord afflicteth vs, hee intendeth to cure and purge vs, but when he with-holdeth theſe meanes, his purpoſe is, to let vs feſter and rot in our ſin, and to let vs abound in theſe groſe humours, which will bring the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and death of the ſoule vnto vs; they are thoſe purging fires, which purifie vs from the droſſe of our corruptions, and therefore when the Lord caſteth vs into them, his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is to make vs pure gold, fit for his treaſurie of eternall happineſſe, but when he letteth vs alone in the droſſe of our ſinnes, his meaning is to let vs ruſt and canker, and to caſt vs away as refuſe ſiluer.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof ſerueth to confute the vaine bragges of <note place="margin">The Papiſts confuted who glory in the outward pomp of their church</note> the Papiſts, who boaſt of the glory, pompe, riches, and the flouriſhing eſtate of their Church; vſing it as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods loue towards them, and of the trueneſſe of their Church and Religion, that they are bleſſed with
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:10737:302"/> great proſperitie, and on the other ſide objecting the croſſe and manifold perſecutions which the profeſſours of the Goſpell are ſubject vnto, as a reproach to their Religion. But ſeeing ſo many ſinnes are not onely committed, but alſo tollerated, yea, defended and countenanced in that Church, their immunitie from afflictions and puniſhments can bee no ſigne of Gods Loue, but rather that in his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie diſpleaſure, hee hath giuen them ouer as a deſperate cure, and becauſe by no meanes they vvill bee reclaymed from their Superſtitions, Idolatryes, Adulteries, and other enormious crimes, that therefore they are giuen vp to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate ſenſe, and to their owne filthy luſts, that ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſinne with greedineſſe, they may treaſure vp againſt themſelues <hi>wrath againſt the day of wrath, and of the declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the iuſt iudgement of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the like vſe alſo may ſecure Worldlings make of this Doctrine, who bleſſe themſelues in their ſinnes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not croſſed in their euill courſes; ſeeing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ought to bee a greater terrour vnto them then this, that the Lord leaueth them to themſelues, and with-hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from them this wholeſome meanes of their amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it ſerueth for the comfort of Gods Children, when as they are ſharply afflicted for their ſinnes, ſeeing this is no ſigne of Gods hatred and of their rejection, but rather of his Loue and Fatherly care ouer them, which cauſeth him to lay vpon them theſe chaſtiſements, that hereby they may bee reclaymed from their ſinnes, and not ſuffered to runne on in their euill courſes to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>The ſecond doctrine which wee here learne is, that if <note place="margin">If we diſhonor God he will diſhonour vs.</note> wee doe neglect our dutie to GOD, hee will make thoſe who owe vs dutie, to neglect this dutie when we moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it; and if wee diſhonour him by our ſinnes, hee will cauſe vs to bee diſhonoured and diſgraced, not onely by our enimies and ſtrangers, but alſo by our neareſt and moſt familiar friends. So becauſe the people of Iſraell, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:10737:303"/> themſelues the ſpouſe and children of God, did by forſaking the Lord their husband and father, and adhae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing vnto Idols, grieuouſly diſhonour his holy name, the Lord layeth vpon them a proportionable puniſhment, that their wiues and daughters ſhould neglect to them all loue, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugall duties, and filiall obedience, whereby they ſhould not onely inwardly bee vexed and grieued in their minds, but alſo outwardly in their names be expoſed to infamie and reproach.</p>
               <p>The like example wee haue elſe where in the booke of God; when <hi>Noah</hi> neglected the duty of temperance and ſobriety towards God, his wicked ſonne <hi>Cham</hi> neglected the dutie of reuerence towards him. When <hi>Elie</hi> was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent towards his ſonnes, that hee would rather diſpleaſe God, by ſuffering them to diſhonour his name, then hee would diſpleaſe his ſonnes by giuing them due correction, whereby they might haue beene reclaymed from their ſinnes, they neglected all dutie to their father, contemned his holy admonitions, and ſo brought ſhame and reproach vpon the whole familie. For the Lord cauſed in one day not onely the glory to depart from Iſraell, when the Arke was taken, which chiefly redounded to the diſhonour of <hi>Elie,</hi> who then was the Iudge of Iſraell, but alſo tooke away his ſonnes, which were to be the glory of his houſe, and togeather with them the office of the Prieſthood, and ſo made him inglorious both in the Common-wealth, Church, and in his owne priuate familie. The like may be ſayd of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who becauſe hee diſhonoured GOD, and cauſed his holy name to be blaſphemed amongſt the Gentiles, by his ſinnes of adulterie and murther, as alſo by his indulgency towards his Children, whom he not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrected not, but not ſo much as reproued; the Lord puniſhed him not onely as hee was a King, but alſo as hee was a Father, by ſuffering both Children and Subjects to neglect their duetie: and as both by the ſword of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Ammon</hi> and his owne vncleaneſſe hee had diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured God; ſo the Lord vſed both the ſword and filthines
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:10737:303"/> of his owne Children to his diſhonour and diſgrace. For <hi>Ammon</hi> his Sonne defiled <hi>Thamar</hi> his Daughter, and then <hi>Abſalon</hi> murthered <hi>Ammon,</hi> becauſe his Father had not as hee ought duely puniſhed his abhominable filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And then againe when as juſtice was not executed againſt <hi>Abſalon</hi> for his murther, according to Gods Law, hee liued to the diſhonour of his Father, who had not giuen glory to God by inflicting deſerued puniſhments for ſinne, defiling his Concubines in the ſight of the people, and thruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him for a time out of his kingdome, with extreame perill of his life.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this Doctrine ſerueth, firſt, to teach vs, that aboue all things wee labour in the performance of all holy Dueties, to aduance the glory of Gods holy Name, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it will come to paſſe, that the Lord will bee carefull of our honour and reputation, and ſo guide and direct by his holy Spirit all thoſe who belong vnto vs, that they ſhall performe all good Dueties vvhich may both credit and comfort vs. Whereas on the other ſide if wee diſhonour God by neglecting ſuch duties as hee requireth, he will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his ſpirit, and giue ouer our inferiours to their owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall ſtubborneſſe and perverſneſſe, and then they by neglecting all good duties will diſhonour and diſgrace vs. 1 Sam. 2. 30. <note place="margin">1 Sam. 2. 30.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, from hence wee learne, whence originally <note place="margin">Whence chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie proceede all diſorders in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</note> proceede all diſorders and enormious Crimes in families, namely, becauſe the chiefe heads neglect their duety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, and ſo diſhonour his holy Name. It is an vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all complaint which ſoundeth in euery mans eares in theſe our dayes, that children are vndutifull to parents, ſtubborne and diſobedient, and that Seruants vvere neuer ſo negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in performance of all dutyes towards their ſuperiours; and men wonders to ſee ſuch a great difference betweene theſe times and thoſe which went before.</p>
               <p>But if wee would goe to the fountaine of theſe euils, and finde out the core of all theſe corruptions, wee ſhall finde that howſoeuer inferiours cannot be excuſed, yet the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:10737:304"/> fault is principally in the Superiours and gouernours. Either becauſe they neglect their dutie towards them, from whom they expect dutie, as by being like <hi>Elie</hi> indulgent, not correcting the vices of their Children, and ſo honouring them more then God, or by being looſe in their gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or lewde and ſcandalous in their example; or finally becauſe they doe not like <hi>Abraham</hi> inſtruct their familie in the wayes of the Lord themſelues, nor take care that they may be inſtructed by others; and ſo liuing in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and neglecting all duties which they owe to God, it is no meruaile that they are vndutifull and diſobedient to parents and gouernours, ſeeing the loue and feare of God is the fountaine of all loue and dutie towards men. Or if ſo be men can pleade not guiltie in all theſe indite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, yet if they be arraigned at the barre of Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and haue their owne conſciences produced as wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes againſt them, they will bee forced to confeſſe, that they haue ben exceeding negligent in performing all good duties towards God himſelfe, and through their coldneſſe, backwardneſſe, want of zeale, and diſobedience, they haue beene wanting to God in the aduancement of his glorie, and contrariwiſe haue diſhonoured his name and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized their profeſsion; and therefore it is moſt juſt with God that hee expoſeth them to ſhame and reproach, by ſuffering their children and ſeruants to liue in ſuch infamous ſinnes and rebellious wickedneſſe, as diſgrace and diſcredite the whole familie, without any inward reſtraint of his ſpirit, or any outward ſtop by afflictions and puniſhments.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, whereas hee ſaith that this people who did <note place="margin">Ignorance doth not free vs from the puniſhment of ſinne.</note> not vnderſtand, that is, who continued ignorant of God and his will ſhould fall, and bee ouerwhelmed with Gods judgements, hence wee obſerue that ignorance will not free vs from puniſhment, but rather will make vs to bee ſwallowed vp of vengeance in the day of wrath. For the better vnderſtanding whereof wee are to conſider what ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance is lawfull and good, and what is ſinfull and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, what ignorance excuſeth and extenuateth ſinne, and
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:10737:304"/> mittigateth puniſhment, and what doth aggrauate them. <note place="margin">Of diuers kinds of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. 1 Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ignorance.</note> And firſt, wee are to know that there is a lawfull and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable kinde of ignorance, when as wee doe not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to <hi>vnderſtand aboue that which is meete to vnderſtand, but that wee doe vnderſtand according to ſobrietie, as God hath dealt to euery man the meaſure of Faith,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth. Rom. 12. 3. And when as wee leaue the ſecret things <note place="margin">Rom. 12. 3.</note> not reuealed in Gods word to the Lord, and earneſtly labour to informe our ſelues in thoſe things which are reuealed as it is Deut. 29. 29. not curiouſly prying into Gods hidden <note place="margin">Deut. 29. 29.</note> Myſteryes, but rather drawing before them the curtaine of reuerent ignorance. For example it is no ſinne to bee ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of Gods ſecret will and counſaile, and of his works before the Creation, of the orders and degrees of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; or not to comprehend by a cleare and diſtinct know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Myſterie of the Trinitie, the hypoſtaticall Vnion of Chriſt two natures; nor the Vnion betweene Chriſt and his Church; ſeeing ſome of theſe are not manifeſtly reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but as it were, in a darke Myrrour; and ſome being infinite and incomprehenſible, can no more bee compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by our ſhallow vnderſtanding, then the whole world can bee graſped in a mans hand, or the maine Ocean can be contained in a nut-ſhell.</p>
               <p>The ſinfull ignorance is of two kindes: The firſt, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary: <note place="margin">Of ſinfull and neceſſary ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</note> the other voluntary and affected. Neceſſary igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is eyther that darkneſſe of vnderſtanding, and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of minde deriued from our firſt Parents, which is one of the branches of originall ſinne; or that actuall ignorance which continueth in vs after wee come to yeares, when as we are depriued of the meanes of knowledge, both which cannot bee excuſed, much leſſe defended, in that wee are ignorant of thoſe things which wee ought to know, and that through our owne default, as being guilty of the ſinne of our firſt Parents: for God in them indued vs with a cleare light of knowledge, but wee in them did fall into ſinne, and thereby put out the light, and defaced the image of God in our vnderſtanding.</p>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:10737:305"/>
               <p> But howſoeuer this ignorance is the euill of ſinne, and <note place="margin">Neceſſarie ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuateth faults.</note> not the euill of puniſhment alone, as ſome haue imagined, yet it doth excuſe other faults and ſinnes, and alſo leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the puniſhment. It doth excuſe wholie a fault before men, when as it is committed through neceſſarie ignorance, all meanes of knowledge being wanting; but before God it doth not wholy excuſe and acquite vs for the reaſons aboue alledged, but onely in part, and as the ſchoolemen ſpeake, it freeth vs <hi>à tanto non à toto,</hi> that is, it leſſeneth our ſinne and puniſhment but doth not wholy take them away: ſo our Sauiour ſaith, that the ſeruant that knew not his maiſters will, and did commit things worthy of ſtripes, ſhould not altogether eſcape vnpuniſhed, but ſhould bee beaten with fewer ſtripes, Luke 12. 48. And that Ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e <note place="margin">Luke 12. 48.</note> and Sidon who wanted thoſe meanes of knowledge which Corazin and Bethſaida neglected, ſhould not altogether be acquitted in the day of judgement, but more eaſilie puniſhed. Math. 11. 21. <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 21.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But yet this alſo is to be held with this caution and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation, <note place="margin">Ignorance as it is the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment of ſinne excuſeth not.</note> that wee vnderſtand it onely of primarie and ſimple ignoraunce, and not of that neceſſarie ignoraunce which is a juſt puniſhment of ſinne; namely, when as men being enlightned with the knowledge of God and his truth, are for with-houlding of this truth in vnrighteouſneſſe, and not louing nor imbracing it, giuen vp of God to a reprobate ſenſe, to blindneſſe of minde, and to bee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and beſotted with errours and ſtronge deluſions. Which was the caſe of many of the Iſraelites in this place, of the Gentiles, Rom. 1. 18. 28. and is the ſtate of many <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 18. 28. 2. Theſ. 2. 10. 11.</note> in theſe dayes, as it was foretould, 2 Theſ. 2. 10. 11. For this ignorance is ſo farre from excuſing other ſinnes, that in it ſelfe it is damnably deſperate; for howſoeuer in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the abſence of meanes it is for the preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſarie, yet if wee reſpect the firſt cauſes thereof it is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and obſtinate.</p>
               <p>Now whereas it may be objected, that the Apoſtle ſaith <note place="margin">The meaning of Acts. 17. 30.</note> vnto the Gentiles, that the Lord did not regard the times
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:10737:305"/> of their ignorance. Act. 17. 30. wee are to know, firſt, that it is not taken ſimply but comparatiuely, that hee did not regard ſo much their ſinnes committed in the time of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, as thoſe which they ſhould commit after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of his truth: and ſecondly, that the ſpeach is not legall, ſhewing what God would exact in the rigour of his juſtice, but Euangelicall, namely, that hee would not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute thoſe ſinnes of ignorance vnto them, but bury them in Chriſts death and obedience, ſo that now they would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him as their Sauiour by a liuely faith, and bring forth the fruits hereof in vnfained repentance, forſaking their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ignorance, and the ſinfull fruits thereof, and labouring after knowledge and holy obedience.</p>
               <p>The other kinde of ignorance which is affected and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, when as men continue ignorant, becauſe they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and contemne the meanes of knowledge offred vnto them, is ſo farre from excuſing other ſinnes, that it doth much aggrauate them, as being it ſelfe in a deſperate degree of ſinne, and alſo the cauſe of much other wickedneſſe; for therefore they refuſe to know their maiſters will, becauſe <note place="margin">Pſal. 36. 3.</note> they are deſperately reſolued not to obey it, and will not vnderſtand, becauſe they will not bee hindered in their courſe of wickedneſſe. Of ſuch the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh. Pſal. 36. 3. <hi>Hee hath left off to vnderſtand, and to doe good,</hi> or <hi>leaſt hee ſhould doe good.</hi> And as this doth aggrauate mens ſinnes, ſo alſo it doth increaſe their puniſhment, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the fearefull meaſure of their condemnation. But of <note place="margin">Verſe 1. &amp; 6. of this Chapter.</note> this I haue already ſpoken, and therefore I will here paſſe it ouer.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is that wee doe not labour to hide our ſinnes vnder this broken vaile of Ignorance, or extenuate our faults by pretending that if wee doe offend, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee are ignorant, and know no better, for our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance after that wee haue ſo long injoyed the light of the Goſpell, cannot bee neceſſarie, but voluntary and wilfull, becauſe wee neglect or diſpiſe the meanes of knowledge; and therefore this ignorance will not excuſe vs, but rather
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:10737:306"/> aggrauate both our ſinne and puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, wee here learne, that when the Lord hath vſed <note place="margin">God giueth ouer thoſe who diſpiſe the means of their converſion.</note> all meanes both by his word and works, his benefites, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements, and more gentle puniſhments, to bring a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to Knowledge, Faith, and Repentance; and they neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe neglecting and contemning theſe meanes, doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in wilfull Ignorance, groſe Infidelitie, and ſecure Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitencie; then the Lord will giue them ouer to their owne wicked courſes, and ſuffer them to fall head-long both into the euils of ſinne, and the euils of puniſhment. For Example, hee will giue them ouer to the blindeneſſe of their mindes, to runne on in Errours, Hereſies, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and Idolatry; to the perverſeneſſe of their wils, to refuſe the good, and chuſe the euill, to their owne vile af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, to commit ſuch abhominable wickedneſſe, as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe, though much corrupted abhorreth and deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and euen to a reprobate ſenſe, that they may heape ſinne vpon ſinne, and treaſure vp againſt themſelues wrath againſt the day of wrath. And when hee hath often aſſayed fatherly corrections, and light afflictions, to amend them, and they will not bee reformed, hee will cauſe them to bee ouertaken by his fearefull plagues and heauie judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and in the end plunge them into the gulfe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and eternall condemnation. An Example hereof wee haue in this place, for when the Iſraelits would not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, nor bee reformed, neyther by Gods Word nor works, his mercies nor iudgements, the Lord cauſed them to fall and to be ouer-whelmed with moſt fearefull puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. When the Gentiles would not ſerue God according to that light of nature, which hee had giuen vnto them, hee gaue them vp to their owne vile affections, and to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate minde. Rom. 1. When the Lord giueth vnto men <note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> meanes of knowledge, and they refuſe inſtruction, then hee will pronounce that fearefull ſentence. 1 Cor. 14. 38. <hi>If any</hi>

                  <hi>man bee ignorant, let him bee ignorant.</hi> If hee long affordeth the meanes of regeneration, and yet men continue in their vnrighteouſneſſe, and naturall corruptions, hee will leaue
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:10737:306"/> them to themſelues, and paſſe vpon them that difinitiue ſentence. Apoc. 22. 11. <hi>Hee that is vniuſt, let him be vniuſt</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 22. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>ſtill; and hee that is filthy, let him bee filthy ſtill.</hi> If hee in his patience and long-ſuffering, doe giue vnto ſinners long time of repentance, and alſo graciouſly affordeth vnto them the meanes of their converſion, then is there nothing to bee expected but vtter deſtruction and deſolation, if by all theſe meanes they will not bee reclaymed. So when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iuda grieuouſly ſinned, the Lord hauing compaſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on his people ſendeth his Prophets to call them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: But when as they mocked the Meſſengers of God, and diſpiſed his words, and miſ-vſed his Prophets, then there being no remedy, the wrath of the Lord was kindled againſt his people, and hee deliuered them into Captiuitie, and made their Land deſolate, as appeareth. 2 Chron. 36. 15. 16. 17. And in the time of our Sauiour <note place="margin">2 Chro. 36. 15. 16.</note> Chriſt, when as they ſtopped their eares againſt his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous call, and would not vnderſtand the great woorke of Redemption wrought by him, which was ſo euidently declared, both by his Word and workes, hee pronounceth againſt them the fearefull ſentence of deſolation and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Luk. 13. 34. 35. <note place="margin">Luk. 13. 34. 35</note>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſon hereof is, becauſe the Lord the moſt wiſe Phyſition of our ſoules, will not looſe his labour, by mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring his Phyſicke to ſuch Patients whoſe diſeaſes are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, and therefore when they wilfully refuſe to bee cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, rend in peeces his preſcripts, pull off his plaiſters, and reject thoſe wholeſome Potions which hee miniſtreth to purge them from their corruptions, and to reſtore them to their ſpirituall health, he giueth them ouer to themſelues to dye and periſh in the ſickneſſe of their ſoules.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as the Lord hateth all other ſinne, ſo his ſoule abhorreth the contempt of his Word, which hee hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to bee the meanes of the converſion and ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all ſinners. And therefore if his ſword of the ſpirit will not make a ſeparation betweene vs and our ſinnes, hee will make it a ſword of vengeance and deſtruction, to cut vs
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:10737:307"/> off in his fierce wrath. For it is neuer drawne out but it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſheth eyther the work of his mercy, or of his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So the Lord ſaith, Eſay. 45. 23. <hi>I haue ſworne by my</hi>

               <p>The vſe hereof ſerueth to teach vs, that with all carefull diligence wee make profitable vſe of the meanes which the Lord hath giuen vs, both for the inlightening of our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, and the reforming of our liues. For if hauing the word of God purely and ſincerely preached, wee continue in wilfull ignorance, and will not vnderſtand, if being allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by God mercies, and inforced by his judgements, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with diuerſly at diuers times hee hath exerciſed vs, wee not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding continue in our impenitency and ſecuritie, what remayneth but that the Lord ſhould giue vs ouer as a deſperate cure, and ſuffer vs to runne on in the courſe of ſinne, vntill at length wee fall into the pit of deſtruction in this life, and into the bottomleſſe gulfe of condemnation in the life to come?</p>

               <p>AND thus much concerning the former part of this <note place="margin">The ſecond part of the Chapter.</note> Chapter, in which I haue ſhewed are contayned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers bils of Inditements againſt the rebellious and apoſtate Church of Iſraell: now becauſe they were deſperately ſuncke in their wickedneſſe, and paſt all hope of recouerie; In the ſecond part of the Chapter hee labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to perſwade with the houſe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> that they ſhould not joyne with them in their ſinnes, nor be ſeduced by their euill example to make the like Apoſtaſie, leaſt accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying them in their defection and rebellion, they were alſo made pertakers of their puniſhments.</p>

The parts thereof are two: The firſt is an admonition to the houſe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> to auoide the ſinnes of the Iſraelits. The ſecond contayneth certaine reaſons to enforce it, taken both from the haynouſneſſe of their ſinnes, and the greatneſſe of their puniſhments. The admonition is expreſſed, verſe 15. <hi>Though thou Iſraell play</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Verſe. </seg>15</label> 
                  <hi>the harlot, yet let not Iudah ſinne: Come not yee into Gilgall, neyther goe yee vp to Beth-auen, nor ſweare, The Lord liueth.</hi> In which admonition he doth firſt ingenerall diſſwade them <note place="margin">The expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> from imitating the Iſraelites in their ſinne, and eſpecially from their Idolatrie and Apoſtaſie; and then hee dehorteth them from certaine ſpeciall meanes, whereby they might eaſily be brought to communicate with them in their impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, namely, joyning with them in irreligious ſocietie, and intermingling Gods pure worſhip with their ſuperſtition and Idolatrie.</p>
               <p>The generall diſſwaſion is contayned in theſe words: <hi>Though thou Iſraell play the harlot, yet let not Iuda ſinne,</hi> as if hee had ſaid, although thou Iſraell being wholy poſſeſſed with a ſpirit of fornication, art ſo deſperately addicted to idolatrie and ſpirituall whoredome, that there is no hope remayning that euer thou wilt be reclaymed, yet let not the Lord be as it were robbed of both his ſonnes in the ſame day, O let not <hi>Iuda</hi> who is not as yet come to that deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate degree of ſin, be ſeduced by your bad neighbour-hood and euill example, and deriue the ſame guilt of iniquitie vpon himſelfe; for ſo the word <hi>Aſsam</hi> vſually ſignifieth ſuch a fault or guilt as is deriued from one to another, the one being the motiue and impulſiue cauſe of the other ſinne.</p>
               <p>The ground of this diſſwaſion was the dangerous eſtate of the people of <hi>Iuda,</hi> firſt in regard of their neere neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour-hoode with theſe idolatrous Iſraelites, who were ready to ſeduce them both by their example and allurements; the which is implyed in the firſt words, <hi>Though thou Iſraell, &amp;c.</hi> As though he ſhould haue ſaid, ſeeing thou Iſrael which art
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:10737:308"/> ſo neere a neighbour and kinſman to <hi>Iuda,</hi> art ſo defiled with idolatrie, that there is great daunger leaſt thou ſhould poyſon them with thy contagion, yet let <hi>Iuda</hi> carefully take heede to auoide thy leprous infection. Secondly this am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyfieth their daunger, that they were already tainted with their ſuperſtition and idolatrie, which through their naturall corruption and proanes vnto this ſin was apt to ſpread fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and further, and therefore like a good Phiſition he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to cure their ague in the firſt fits, and to ſtay them from falling any deeper into this ſickneſſe of ſinne. And to this purpoſe hee admoniſheth them that they ſhould not imitate the Iſraelites in their Idolatrie, but purge away their dreggs of ſuperſtition, wherewith they were alreadie corrupted, and reſtore Gods pure worſhip in his Temple amongſt them, by the office and Miniſterie of his true Prieſts and Leuites.</p>
               <p>Now howſoeuer this admonition did principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the people of Iuda, yet the Prophet doth here pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it to the Iſraelites, ſpeaking of Iuda in the third per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as being abſent: And this hee doth becauſe hee was a Prophet purpoſely ſent to the houſe of Iſraell, to call them to repentance, and therefore hee admoniſheth the people of Iuda in their hearing to take heed of their ſinnes, and to retaine amongſt them Gods pure worſhip, partly that hee might hereby make them aſhamed of their ſinnefull ſtate, which was a juſt cauſe why their brethren ſhould ſhun their company, and partly that by a certaine kinde of emulation hee might draw them likewiſe to repentance.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of the generall diſſwaſion, whereby hee dehorteth them from imitating their ſinnes: In the next wordes hee diſſwadeth them from the meanes, by the vſe whereof they might be intangled in their ſinnes; and theſe are two: the firſt was their frequenting of places dedicated to Idolatrie: the other joyning with them in their ſuperſtitions and idolatrous ſeruice, in which they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled the worſhip of God with the worſhip of idols, and the commandements of God with their owne inuentions.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:10737:308"/> The firſt meanes is contayned in theſe words, <hi>Come not yee into Gilgal, neither goe yee vp to Beth-auen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the vnderſtanding whereof wee are to know, that this Gilgall vvas a towne ſcituate neere Ierricho, on the eaſt part thereof beyond Iordaine, which was exceeding fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous amongſt the people of Iſraell and Iuda, for there the Arke of God firſt reſted after they were entred into the land of promiſe; there <hi>Ioſua</hi> erected an Alter in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall remembraunce of that famous miracle, whereby <hi>Iordan</hi> was diuided, ſo that the Iſraelites paſſed through on drye ground; there the Iſraelites were firſt circumciſed after they came into the land of promiſe, and the ſhame of vncircumciſion was taken from them; from whence alſo it had it name Gilgal or Galgal, which ſignifieth to take away, as appeareth, Ioſua 5. 9. There alſo they firſt kept <note place="margin">Ioſ. 5. 9. 15.</note> the feaſt of the Paſſeouer; there the Manna ceaſing the people did firſt eate the bread and fruits of the land; there the Angell appeared to <hi>Ioſua,</hi> commanding him to put off his ſhoes, becauſe the place was holy, Ioſu. 5. 15. And here alſo <hi>Saul</hi> the firſt King of Iſraell was annointed. By all which memorable accidents in this place it was much enobled amongſt the people.</p>
               <p>By the other place Beth-auen, wee are here to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Bethel, of which name there were two townes, the one belonged to the tribe of <hi>Beniamin,</hi> as appeareth, Ioſ. 18. <note place="margin">Ioſ. 18. 22.</note> 22. the other to the tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> as is manifeſt, Iud. 1. <note place="margin">Iudg. 1. 22.</note> 22. The which in former times was called Luz, which name it had from the abundaunce of Almonds which there grew. But when <hi>Iacob</hi> reſted there and ſaw the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Angels aſcending and diſcending vpon the Ladder, hee changed the name, and called it Beth-el, that is, <hi>the houſe of God,</hi> as appeareth, Gene. 28. 19. This Beth-el is <note place="margin">Gen. 28. 19.</note> here vnderſtood, and is called Beth-auen, not that they were both one Citie, for beſides this Beth-el, there was another towne neere adjoyning vnto it, which was called Beth-auen, Ioſu. 7. 2. and 18. 12. 13. But the Prophet doth here call <note place="margin">Ioſ. 7. 2. and 18 12. 13.</note>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:10737:309"/> Beth-el Beth-auen by way of reproach; becauſe of the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie which was there committed, for as it was firſt called Luz, and then becauſe of <hi>Iacobs</hi> viſion Beth-el, although there was another Citie of that name. So contrariwiſe, when it was abuſed to idolatrie, the name was changed and called Beth-auen, that is, a houſe of vanitie and idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, for an idoll, and vanitie, or nothing, are vſed the one for the other. So Hoſ. 6. 8. <hi>Gilead is a citie of them that worke,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">So Hoſ. 6. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Auen,</hi> that is, <hi>iniquitie, vanitie, or idolatrie.</hi> So 1 Corint. 8. <hi>An idoll is nothing,</hi> or a vaine thing. So that the meaning <note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.</note> is, as if hee had ſaid, it is vnworthie now the name of Beth-el, the houſe of God, becauſe it is conſecrated to idolatrie, and therefore let it bee called <hi>Beth-auen</hi> rather, that is, a houſe of vanitie, impietie, and idolatrie.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſon why Iuda is forbidden to aſcend into theſe places was, becauſe they were conſecrated to idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous worſhip. For when <hi>Iereboam</hi> tooke vpon him the gouernment, as on the one ſide hee ſaw that it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to haue a place for the publicke ſeruice of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe religion is the ſureſt bond of all good ſocietie and gouernment, ſo on the other ſide conſulting with no better a counſailour then humane wiſedome, hee thought it dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to his ſtate, that the people ſhould goe vp to Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, leaſt hauing too much familiaritie and intercourſe of friendſhip with the men of Iuda, his people ſhould bee drawne to make a defection from him to the kingdome of the houſe of <hi>Dauid.</hi> And therefore hee reſolued vpon this <note place="margin">1 King. 12. 27.</note> courſe, as the ſafeſt, to appoynt in his owne country ſome places for the publike exerciſes of Religion. Now becauſe there ſeemed to bee ſome difficultie to with-draw the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the Temple which was expreſly appoynted by God for this purpoſe, vnto other places which were as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly prohibited, therefore in wicked pollicie hee made choiſe of ſuch places as were moſt famous, and vnto which the people were moſt devoted, for ſome ſpeciall priuiled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which they had had in former time, that hereby he might
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:10737:309"/> blinde their judgement and allure their affection. Now none ſeemed fitter for his purpoſe then theſe two: ſeeing Gilgal was in ſpeciall account with the people, becauſe of all thoſe memorable things there done, of which I haue already ſpoken, and eſpecially in reſpect of the appearing of the Angell, who alſo ſayed that it was holy ground, though in truth this was ſpoken not in regard of the place it ſelfe, but in regard of Gods glorious preſence at that time. And Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell was eſteemed not onely in reſpect of the name, but alſo in that formerly <hi>Iacob</hi> had there erected an Aulter, and <note place="margin">Gen. 28.</note> offered Sacrifices, as appeareth. Gen. 28. The which alſo was a ſtrong motiue to perſwade the people, who are in themſelues inclinable to imitate the example of their fore-fathers, ſeeing they had ſuch an holy Patriarch for their Preſident. Although in truth this was no good reaſon, though it were plauſible inough, to moue them to this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, ſeeing that was but an extraordinary act of <hi>Iacob,</hi> not to bee imitated, eſpecially ſeeing by the expreſſe Law of God, his publike worſhip was reſtrained to Ieruſalem, and therefore they were not to looke what <hi>Iacob</hi> did, but what the Lord commanded in his Law.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, theſe colours ſerued to bleere the eyes of the people, and to bring them vnto a ſuperſtitious conceipt of theſe places aboue other, and therefore he made choyſe of theſe places and erected groues, and Temples, and Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for the worſhip of God in Idols. Concerning Beth-ell there is no queſtion, for it is plainely ſaid that <hi>Ieroboam</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected his Idols in Beth-ell and Dan. 1 King. 12. 29. As <note place="margin">1 King. 12. 29.</note> alſo elſe where: for Gilgall though there bee no ſuch direct Teſtimony, yet it may clearely bee proued, that it was a place famous, or rather infamous for the impious Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try there committed, as appeareth. Hoſ. 9. 15. and 12. 11. <note place="margin">Hoſ. 9. 15. and 12 11. Amos. 4. 4.</note> Amos. 4. 4.</p>
               <p>The reaſon then why the Prophet doth ſo earneſtly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the people of Iuda to come at Gilgall and Beth-auen was, not onely becauſe they were conſecrated vnto idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atry, and therefore in this reſpect daungerous, in that by
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:10737:310"/> frequenting theſe Idolatrous places, they might eaſily bee ſeduced to joyne with them in their falſe worſhip, but alſo becauſe there was more perill of theſe places then of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in regard of that reuerend eſtimation the people had of them, for the reaſons aboueſaid. And this alſo was the cauſe, why hee ſpecially maketh mention of theſe two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, vnder which he comprehendeth all the reſt of like qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, becauſe as they were more famous then eyther Dan or any other of the high places, ſo alſo in reſpect of their credit with the people, much more dangerous.</p>
               <p>Now in the forme of the prohibition, wee are further to obſerue, that hee doth not onely prohibite them to ſacrifice in theſe places, but not ſo much as to aſcend or goe vnto them, not that it was not lawfull for them to come into theſe places for their ciuill affaires, and worldly buſineſſes, but by this ſtrait prohibition, hee implyeth that hee would as little as might be, haue them to frequent the company of Idolaters; but eſpecially, that it was altogether vnlawfull for them who profeſſed Gods true Religion, to bee preſent at their idolatrous ſacrifices and other ſolemnities, whereby in time they would bee ſeduced to immitate them in their ſuperſtitions.</p>
               <p>And thus wee haue ſeene what was the firſt meanes of idolatrie, the other is that they ſhould not ioyne with them in their religion, which conſiſted of true and falſe worſhip mingled together; In theſe words, <hi>nor ſweare the Lord liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi> In which words hee doth not forbid the lawfull vſe of an oath, which being made in truth, righteouſneſſe, and judgement, is a part of Gods worſhip; which is expreſly commaunded in his word, as appeareth, Deut. 6. 13. and <note place="margin">Deut. 6. 13.</note> 10. 20. Ier. 4. 2. But onely reſtrayneth them from imitating the practiſe of the Idolatrous Iſraelites; who ioyned the worſhip of God preſcribed in his word with their owne inventions, and ſuperſtitions, and though they ſerued idols yet ſwore not onely by them; but alſo by the true <hi>Iehouah,</hi> as appeareth plainely, Amos. 8. 14. <hi>They ſweare by the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Amos. 8. 14.</note>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:10737:310"/> 
                  <hi>ſinne of Samaria, and ſay thy God O Dan liueth, &amp;c.</hi> So <note place="margin">Zeph. 1. 5.</note> Zeph. 1. 5. the Lord threatneth his judgements againſt thoſe in Iuda, vvho did worſhip and ſweare by the Lord, and ſweare by <hi>Malcham,</hi> The ſinne therefore which is here forbidden is, their ioyning a true oath with falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the ſeruice of God with the ſeruice of idols. So that theſe words haue reference to the former, after this manner; if yee goe to Gilgall and Beth-auen to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with idols in their idolatrie, doe not preſume to ſweare by the Lord, nor to make profeſsion of his religion; for he cannot abide that there ſhould bee any mixture of his true worſhip with idolatrie, nor that the ſame mouth ſhould ſweare by his name, and call vpon idols. Neither doth hee heere ſimply forbid them to ſweare at all, but that they ſhould not vſe this forme, <hi>the Lord liueth.</hi> As though hee ſhould ſay, if yee worſhip Idols ſweare by them alſo, if yee will, but haue nothing to doe with my name in your oathes, vnleſſe you turne from your idolatrie. And according to this ſenſe the words may fitly be reade (as a learned Hebritian <note place="margin">Druſius.</note> hath obſerued) by a diſiunction after this manner, <hi>Come not at Gilgall,</hi> or <hi>ſweare not the Lord liueth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now vnder this one perticular part of Gods ſeruice by an <note place="margin">Pſal. 63. 11.</note> oath, is comprehended his whole worſhip, as alſo it is taken, Pſalm. 63. 11. And ſo generally they are here forbidden to make any manner of mixture and compoſition betweene idolatrie, and any part of Gods true worſhip. So that the <note place="margin">1 King. 18.</note> Lord requireth of them the ſame thing which <hi>Elias</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red afore times of the Iſraelits, 1 King. 18. If <hi>Baal</hi> be God ſerue him, but if <hi>Iehouah</hi> be God ſerue him, that is, you are <note place="margin">Pſal. 50. 16. Math. 6. 4.

               <p>And thus much concerning the meaning of the words. <note place="margin">The Lord vſeth the meanes of our conuerſion vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till our eſtate is deſperate.</note> The doctrines which doe hence ariſe are diuers: Firſt vve may here obſerue that as the Lord giueth ouer thoſe whoſe eſtate is deſperate and incurable to runne on in the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:10737:311"/> courſe of ſinne, to their deſtruction. So contrariwiſe where there remayneth the leaſt ſhew of hope hee neuer forſaketh his people, but vſeth all meanes to bring them to Repentaunce, that they may bee ſaued. An example hereof wee haue in this place, for when the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell were paſt cure, hee cauſeth his Prophet to labour with the men of Iuda for their reformation, who were not ſo deepely ſunke in rebellion. So when neyther the heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sermons, nor wonderfull Miracles of Ieſus Chriſt, would draw the Iewes to repentance, hee cauſeth the Apoſtles to preach the Goſpell to the Gentiles, that they at leaſt might bee gathered to his Church, and that hereby in an holy emulation the Iewes alſo might bee converted to the Faith. So although the Land of Iuda vvas exceedingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with ſin, ſo as from the crowne of the head vnto the ſole of the foote there was nothing ſound in this polliticke body, yet doth hee when they profeſſed open emnitie, call them to a parley, offering vnto them reaſonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Peace, namely, that if they would turne vnto him, by vnfained repentance, hee would make their ſcarlet ſinnes as white as ſnow.

               <p>Now the cauſe hereof is not in any deſert of ſinners, who hauing already by their ſinnes prouoked Gods fierce wrath, rather merit his heauie puniſhments; but in the Lord himſelfe, who is of ſuch infinite mercy, that he deſireth not the deſtruction but the converſion of ſinners, &amp; would haue all men to bee ſaued, and come to true knowledge and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayned repentance, as appeareth. Ezech. 33. 11. 1 Tim. 2. 4. <note place="margin">Ezech. 33. 11. 1 Tim. 2. 4.</note> And to this purpoſe hee ſendeth his Prophets to call them, and multiplyeth his benefits to allure them, and alſo viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth their ſinnes with gentle chaſtiſements that hee may reclayme them, yea, and after they haue long had theſe meanes of converſion, the Lord in infinite patience is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to wayte their leaſure, as it is.

               <p> The vſe hereof ſerueth, firſt to confute the practiſe of the Browniſts, who leaue and forſake the Church of Chriſt for ſome ſmall ſpots and little wrinkles, their Miniſters refuſing to preach, and the people to heare in our congregations. But herein they nothing reſemble the Lord, whoſe children they would ſeeme to be, who when the Church of Iſrael had made a feareful apoſtaſie from Gods true religion, and was wholly defiled with ſuperſtition, idolatrie, and all wickedneſſe, and obſtinately continued in theſe ſinnes, notwithſtanding the manifold and continuall meanes which the Lord vſed to call them to repentance; yet ſtill hee ſendeth his Prophets vnto them, to teach, admoniſh, and reproue them, that they might be brought to amendment; and when as they deſperately perſeuered in ſinne, and were now paſt all hope of recouerie, he cauſeth his Prophet to admoniſh the Iewes, to auoid their ſinnes and puniſhments, when as their ſtate alſo was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly corrupted.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſerueth for our comfort and incouragement, <note place="margin">The Lord hath mercy in ſtore for thoſe who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill waies.</note> if that now at the length we will forſake our euill waies, and take hold of the meanes of our conuerſion, whileſt God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth them vnto vs. For howſoeuer wee are ſunke deepe in our rebellion, and haue many waies prouoked Gods wrath, continuing in our ſinnes, notwithſtanding the Lord hath af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded vs ſuch plentifull meanes to bring vs to amendment; yet if now wee will begin a new courſe, and conſecrate our ſelues to the ſeruice of God, there is aſſured hope of pardon. For yet the Lord waiteth that hee may haue mercie vpon vs, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 30. 68.</note> yet he patiently granteth vnto vs the meanes of our conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and wee may aſſure our ſelues that if hee be ſo gratious when as wee obſtinately perſeuere in ſinne, hee will be much more mercifull, if we turne vnto him by true repentance. But on the other ſide, if wee contemne ſo great a mercie of God, we ſhall haue a more fearefull iudgement laid vpon vs: for <hi>laeſa patientia furor,</hi> the greater Gods patience is which wee deſpiſe, the more furious reuenge hee will take on vs in the day of his viſitation: Rom. 2. 4. 5.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be obſerued is, that Gods Miniſters <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. 5.</note>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:10737:312"/> ought not to ſurceaſe their paines in their Miniſterie, though <note place="margin">The Miniſters muſt not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe their paines in the Miniſterie.</note> they plainly diſcerne that the eſtate of the people committed to their charge is altogether deſperate, and paſt hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie. For though there were no apparance of hope at home, yet he is painfully to perſiſt in the worke of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, that hee may conuert thoſe who are abroad, and want the preaching of the word, that ſo hee may helpe to gather thoſe into the Church which are elected, and increaſe the number of the faithfull, as much as in him lieth. So when the Iſraelites, to whom our Prophet was ſent, were paſt cure, he laboureth to conuert the Iewes vnto God. And ſo when the Iewes deſperately refuſed the meanes of their conuerſion and ſaluation, the Apoſtles ceaſed not their labours, but turned to the Gentiles, and by their painfull preaching endeuoured to conuert them vnto the faith. For howſoeuer our hearers profit not, there is a neceſſitie that lieth vpon vs, and a feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full woe denounced againſt vs if we preach not the Goſpell, 1. Cor. 9. 16. Whatſoeuer bee the ſucceſſe of our labours, wee <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 16.</note> are charged as wee will anſwere it <hi>before God, and before the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, which ſhall iudge the quicke and the dead at his appearing; that we preach the word, and be inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, and that wee improue, rebuke, exhort, with all long ſuffering and doctrine:</hi> 2. Tim. 4. 1. 2. Whether the people <note place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1. 2.</note> will heare vs or no, we muſt tell them of their ſinnes, and giue them warning of Gods approching iudgements; and then though they die in their ſinnes, yet wee haue diſcharged our dutie, and ſhall ſaue our owne ſoules: Ezech. 33. 7. 8. 9. <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>The vſe hereof ſerueth to reprooue thoſe, who ſurceaſe their paines in the worke of the Miniſterie, becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the fruite of their labours, but contrariwiſe finde, that the more diligently they preach vnto their people, the more obſtinately they contemne the meanes of their ſaluation, lothe the food of their ſoules, and perſiſt in their impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie. For the neglect of other mens duties muſt not be an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to make vs neglect ours, but rather ſhould make vs more earneſt in the worke of the Miniſterie. Neither doe we know whom, nor when the Lord will call; the Spirit bloweth

                  <hi>Paul.</hi> Beſides, though they had certaine aſſurance that they ſhould neuer conuert a ſoule of thoſe people which are committed to them, nor build vp any one in the faith of Chriſt, yet are they not diſcharged of their worke, nor here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by haue receiued a priuiledge of idleneſſe; ſeeing when theſe who haue often heard them, doe obſtinately ſtop their eares, there are perhaps others who would willingly haue the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of their Miniſterie. And though there were not, yet muſt we preach the word, euen when wee are aſſured that it is the ſauour of death vnto death, becauſe the Lord who hath ſet vs on worke, and will ſurely pay vs our wages, is as well glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by executing iuſtice againſt obſtinate ſinners, as by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercie to thoſe who are by his word moued to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and amendment of life.</p>
               <p>The third thing to be obſerued is, that as al men had need <note place="margin">The danger of euill neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood.</note> to be admoniſhed of their waies in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> miniſterie of the word, ſo eſpecially thoſe which liue neere vnto wicked and vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neighbours, who by their manifold inducements, allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and euill examples, are alwaies readie to ſeduce them out of the way of righteouſneſſe into the way of ſinne. For this was the caſe of the people of the Iewes in this place, who being themſelues corrupted, had the wicked Iſraelites for their neighbours, who by all meanes were ready to draw them more and more from God, into the bywaies of ſin and wickedneſſe; and therefore the Lord thought it good and neceſſarie to ſtop them in theſe euill courſes, not only by the admonitions of their owne Prophets, who were purpoſely ſent vnto them, but alſo cauſeth our Prophet, who was ſent to the Iſraelites, to admoniſh them to beware of being corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their euill example. So when the people of Iſrael were to enter into the land of Canaan, where they ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed about with idolatrous Gentiles; how often and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:10737:313"/> doth the Lord admoniſh them, to beware of being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from his worſhip and ſeruice, by their wicked exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and alluring inticements.</p>
               <p>And not without good cauſe are all good meanes careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſed in this caſe, ſeeing on the one ſide ſinne in it own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is no leſſe infectious then the plague or leproſie, apt to ſpread from man to man, familie to familie, citie to citie, and countrie to countrie; and ſeeing on the other ſide we are full of the groſſe humours of corruption, whereby we are excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding apt to receiue the infection; and therfore if the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome preſeruatiues of admonition, inſtruction, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, be not often and carefully applied, we are daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to certaine danger of approching deſtruction.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof ſerueth to teach vs, that as at all times wee <note place="margin">We muſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently heare our ſelues ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed and reprooued.</note> be ready with all meekneſſe and patience, to heare our ſelues admoniſhed, and our ſinnes reproued, ſo eſpecially when we are expoſed to theſe tentations, and are in danger to be infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted through the neighbourhood of wicked men; ſeeing they are ſtiffe in euill, we weak in good; they earneſt in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vs into ſinne, and wee weake in making reſiſtance; they apt to infect vs, and we as apt to receiue infection. And for as much as we liue in dangerous times, wherein faith, pietie and iuſtice exceedingly faile amongſt men, and contrariwiſe all manner of ſinne and wickedneſſe aboundeth vpon the face of the earth; let vs not only carefully watch ouer our owne hearts and waies, that we may eſcape theſe dangers, but alſo let vs be content to ſuffer the Lords watchmen to ouerſee vs; and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they obſeruing out declining from good things, coldneſſe in holy duties, and proneneſſe vnto the ſinnes of theſe ſinfull times, doe out of Gods word admoniſh vs either publikely or priuately of our defection and corruption, and exhort vs to amendment, let vs patiently hearken to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions and exhortations, ſeeing wee ſhall finde all little enough to keep vs from being carried away with the ſtreame of common corruptions, and to preſerue vs from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the contagion of theſe ſinfull times. Yea and not only let vs hearken to the admonitions of Gods Miniſters in
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:10737:313"/> the miniſterie of the word; but alſo let priuate men in the feare of God both performe the dutie of admonition, when they ſee their neighbour readie to fall into ſinne, or alreadie fallen, and alſo when themſelues need, be as readie to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed of their faults, as being an excellent meanes ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by God, both for the reſtraining of men from ſinne, before it is committed, and to reſtore them by true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance when they haue committed it. And this mutuall dutie of admonition is commended vnto vs, Leuit. 19. 17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thine heart, but thou ſhalt plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke</hi>

And contrariwiſe, <hi>He that refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth inſtruction, deſpiſeth his owne ſoule; but hee that obeyeth correction, getteth vnderſtanding,</hi> Pro. 15. 32.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, whereas the Lord by his Prophet doth firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh <note place="margin">They who would auoid ſin muſt alſo auoid the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked companie of ſinners.</note> the people of Iuda, to auoide the ſinnes of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, and then in the next place doth dehort them from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Gilgal, that is, from hauing any neere familiaritie or ſocietie with the ſuperſtitious Iſraelites, eſpecially in their idolatrous ſeruice; hence wee learne firſt in generall, that whoſoeuer will auoid ſin, muſt alſo auoid the meanes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might be induced to fall into it, and then more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that he auoid the ſocietie and neere familiaritie of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as being a ſingular inducement to draw men into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of wickednes. This <hi>Dauid</hi> knew well, and therefore being reſolued to obſerue Gods law, and ſeeing ſome kind of impoſſibilitie, that he ſhould ſo do, if the wicked did fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent his companie; in the firſt place hee baniſheth them, and then reſolueth to go forward in his courſe, Pſal. 119. 115. <hi>Away from me yee wicked, for I will keep the Commandements</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 115.</note> 
                  <hi>of my God.</hi> Sinne is the canker of the ſoule; and therefore as the canker hauing infected one part of the bodie, goeth vnto the next, till all be wholly corrupted; ſo ſin hauing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:10737:314"/> one perſon of a family, or one familie of a citie, ſtayeth not here, but infecteth the next, and ſo ſpreadeth by degrees till it haue corrupted the whole body: this the Apoſtle ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, 1. Cor. 5. 6. where exhorting them to excommunicate <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6.</note> the iuceſtuous perſon, he vſeth this as his argument, that <hi>A little leauen leaueneth the whole lumpe;</hi> noting thereby the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious nature of ſin, which through the corruption of one member tainteth the whole bodie: as therefore men care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully auoid the companie of ſuch as are infected with conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious diſeaſes, to preſerue their bodies in health; ſo ſhould we much more carefully flee the ſocietie of thoſe who are grieuouſly infected with the diſeaſes of ſinne, both becauſe our ſoules are more apt to receiue this ſpirituall contagion, then our bodies the other, and alſo becauſe this infection is much more dangerous and pernitious.</p>
               <p>Yet more eſpecially, we here learne, carefully to auoide the company of idolaters, becauſe ſuch is our inclinablenes <note place="margin">We muſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully auoid the company of idolaters.</note> thereunto, that by their example and perſwaſions, we may eaſily bee corrupted. And this moued the Prophet heere to perſwade the people of Iuda not to go to Gilgal and Betha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, leſt intertaining neere familiaritie and friendſhip with the ſuperſtitious Iſraelites, they ſhould bee infected with their idolatrie. So that here we learne, that the companie of idolaters is to be auoided in two reſpects, 1. y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we are not to haue any neere familiaritie and friendſhip with them, in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ſocietie. Secondly, that we muſt not ioyne with them in their idolatrous ſeruice. In the former reſpect we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue this generall rule, not to haue any entercourſe of dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with them, further then humane neceſſitie requireth; as for example, when we ſell our, or buy their commodities, which onely then is lawfull, or at leaſt expedient, when we cannot conueniently vſe the like merchandize in ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where Gods truth is profeſſed and maintained. More eſpecially, here is condemned the neere contract of mariage betweene profeſſors of true religion, &amp; idolaters; the which was the ſinne of the faithful before the floud, which brought that vniuerſall deluge, firſt of ſin, and then of water vpon the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:10737:314"/> whole earth, Gen. 6. 2. this was <hi>Salomons</hi> ſin whereby he was <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 6. 2. 1. <hi>King.</hi> 11. 4.</note> drawne vnto idolatrie, 1. King. 11. 4. and the chiefe cauſe of <hi>Ahabs</hi> wickednes, becauſe he had lincked himſelfe in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with idolatrous <hi>Ieſabel,</hi> as appeareth, 1. King. 16. 31. So <note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 16. 31.</note> this is rendred as a reaſon, why <hi>Iehoram</hi> the ſonne of good <hi>Iehoſaphat,</hi> forſooke his fathers ſteps, and committed groſſe idolatrie, becauſe he married <hi>Ahabs</hi> daughter, 2. King. 8. 18. <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 8. 18.</note> and this was the cauſe of <hi>Iudahs</hi> tranſgreſſion, and <hi>Iſraels</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination, becauſe they maried the daughters of a ſtrange god, Malac. 2. 11. Hence it was, that when the people repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Malach.</hi> 2. 11.</note> of this ſinne, they did not only leaue off to marrie wiues of the Gentiles, but alſo diuorced thoſe whom they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie married, becauſe they were notable inſtruments to encline them to idolatrie, Ezra. 10. 1. 2. 3.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing which we here learne, is, that we muſt <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 1. 2. 3. We muſt not communicate with idolaters, in their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous ſeruice.</note> not by any meanes keepe companie or communicate with idolaters in their idolatrous ſeruice: for whereas he doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the men of Iuda from going vnto Gilgal and Betha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, he principally intendeth that they ſhould not come into their temples, which were conſecrated to idolatrie, nor bee preſent with them at their idoll ſeruice. This argument the Apoſtle doth purpoſely intreate of, 1. Cor. 8. where he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.</note> the Corinthians from communicating with idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in their temples, at their idoll feaſts; becauſe hereby they gaue a grieuous ſcandall to their weake brethren: and in the tenth chapter he telleth them, that they <hi>could not drink</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>of the cup of the Lord, and the cup of diuels, nor be partakers of the Lords table, and the table of diuels,</hi> verſ. 21. intimating thereby, that as thoſe who worthily communicate at the Lords table, are vnited vnto Chriſt and made one with him: ſo they that communicate with idols in their idolatrous ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and Sacraments, are thereby vnited vnto idols, and made one with them, &amp; conſequently ceaſe to be the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt, for we cannot haue communion with both, there being no more agreement betweene them, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene light and darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>But heere ſome obiect, that they may lawfully preſent
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:10737:315"/> their bodies at idolatrous ſeruice, ſo that they reſerue their <note place="margin">An obiection of tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers anſwered</note> hearts for Gods pure worſhip. To which I anſwere, that if this aſſertion were true, then were al Gods holy Martyrs but ſimple men, who rather were content to endure exquiſite torments, then giue any outward approbation to idolatrie; then were the three children far out of the way, who rather choſe to be caſt into the fierie furnace, then they would bow to <hi>Nebuchadnezers</hi> Idoll. But indeed it is far otherwiſe, for the Lord who hath created and redeemed as well the bodie as the ſoule, hath wholly appropriated, as well the one as the other, for his worſhip and ſeruice. So 1. Cor. 6. 20. <hi>Yee are</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20.</note> 
                  <hi>bought with a price, therefore glorifie God in your bodie, and in your ſpirits, for they are Gods.</hi> Rom. 12. 1. the Apoſtle exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1.</note> vs to offer our bodie a liuely ſacrifice vnto God. And 2. Cor. 6. 17. <hi>Come out from amongst them, and ſeparate your</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>ſelues, ſaith the Lord, and touch no vncleane thing, and I will receiue you.</hi> So Eſay 52. 11. And the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> doth exhort <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſay</hi> 52. 11.</note> vs, to keep not our ſoules alone, but our ſelues, that is, our whole perſon from idols, 1. Ioh. 5. 21. So in the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, <note place="margin">1. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 21.</note> the outward bowing to images is preciſely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden. And of this there is great reaſon: for what husband hauing a wife, would endure that ſhe ſhould proſtitute her bodie to commit whoredome, though ſhe ſhould neuer ſo deepely proteſt that ſhee reſerued her heart for him? how much leſſe will the Lord admit ſuch an excuſe, when thoſe who profeſſe themſelues his ſpouſe commit ſpiritual whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with idols in their bodies? Again, they who go thus far, will not ſtay heere, but in the end will worſhip idols, as well with their ſoules as with their bodies. This progreſſe of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters the Pſalmiſt excellently expreſſeth, Pſalm. 106. 35. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 106. 35.</note> where he ſaith, that firſt they mingled themſelues with ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, and then they learned their workes, and fell to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping their idols, and in concluſion became ſo ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly deuout in their idolatrie, that they did not ſticke to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their owne ſonnes and daughters vnto diuels, which tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their vtter ruine. As therfore <hi>Ioſeph</hi> when hereſolued, not to commit adulterie with his miſtreſſe, did flee out of
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:10737:315"/> her company, ſo if we would not commit ſpirituall whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome with idols, we muſt haue no ſocietie with them.</p>
               <p>Againſt this is obiected, that the Prophet permitted <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Naamans</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizers.</note> 
                  <hi>Naaman</hi> to bow himſelfe in the houſe of <hi>Rimmon.</hi> I anſwere, that this bowing was in <hi>Naamans</hi> intention a ciuill worſhip performed not to the idoll, but to his maſter who did leane on him; which notwithſtanding his owne conſcience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as a ſinne, in that being a conuert, he vouchſafed the idoll his preſence, and bowed before him, though not vnto him; and therefore he prayeth the Lord to be mercifull vnto him in pardoning this ſin: nether doth the Prophet in ſaying, Goe in peace, approue this action, but only diſmiſſeth him with this ciuill ſalutation, as not being willing to diſcourage him at his firſt entrance into the profeſſion of Gods true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by impoſing vpon him this heauie taske, to incurre his maſters vtter diſpleaſure, for denying vnto him his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof ſerueth: Firſt, to reproue ſuch as intertaine neere familiaritie with idolaters; as for example, thoſe who <note place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 5. Thoſe repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine neere familiaritie with idolaters.</note> make choice of Papiſts, to bee their intimate and inward friends, who exceed in all kinds of groſſe idolatrie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſuch as trauell into Popiſh and idolatrous countries, being moued hereunto, either through meere cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſitie to ſee faſhions, or for ſome needleſſe commoditie, which can in no ſort counteruaile the manifold dangers whereunto they expoſe themſelues, by conſorting with ſuch as are ſtill readie to allure them to commit idolatrie.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſuch amongſt vs, who either for wealth or friends, or ſome other worldly reſpects, lincke themſelues in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with Popiſh idolaters, taking into their boſomes a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, which is ſtill readie to tempt and intice them to break Gods Commandements, concerning his pure worſhip, and to imbrace idolatrie and ſuperſtition, 2.

               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, their practiſe is here reproued, who either vpon fantaſticall curioſitie, or for commoditie, or for feare of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, are readie to preſent their bodies before the idoll of the Maſſe, and to bow before an image, imagining that
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:10737:316"/> they are to be excuſed, if they reſerue their hearts for God. But let ſuch know, that herein they rob God of his glorie, in denying to make publike profeſſion of his true religion; they giue a grieuous offence to their weake brethren, who ſee their outward practiſe, and do not ſee their inward intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they ſpoile the Lord of his right, in that they doe not worſhip him in the whole man, but with a part onely; they caſt themſelues into deſperate danger, of making a further apoſtaſie from God and his true religion, and of embracing idolatrie both in bodie and minde; they depriue themſelues of a good teſtimonie of their owne ſaluation; in a word, they <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 10.</note> deny Ieſus Chriſt and his truth before men, and therfore vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they repent of this ſinne, he will alſo deny them before his Father in heauen, as it is Matth. 10. 33. <note place="margin">

               <p>Fiftly, we here learne, that all places loſe their dignitie, and become infamous, when as they are defiled with ſinne, <note place="margin">All places loſe their dignitie when they are defiled with ſinne, and conſecrated to idolatrie.</note> and conſecrated to idolatrie; ſo famous Gilgal, which was ennobled by many memorable accidents which there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, became through the idolatrie there committed ſo infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and of ſuch bad note, that the people of Iuda are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to reſort vnto it. And Beth-el, which in former times was the houſe of God, by the like abuſe became Beth-auen, a houſe of vanitie. So Shilo which was greatly renowned, becauſe God had ſet his name there, and placed therein his Tabernacle and Arke, the viſible ſignes of his preſence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came afterwards as remarkeable for Gods heauie iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as before it had been for his great mercies, through the grieuous ſinnes therein committed; ſo as the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> doth propound it, as a paterne and example of Gods fearefull wrath, to keep the people of Iuda from glorying in the Temple, Ier. 7. 12.

               </p>
               <p>The vſe hereof ſerueth firſt to admoniſh vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we reade our leſſon out of all theſe examples, which were written for our learning; namely, that we do not vaunt of our land &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, as being a place wherin the Church is ſeated, Gods true religion planted, and his pure and ſincere worſhip eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and exerciſed: for if we ſecurely go on in ſin, ſheltering our ſelues from the heate of Gods anger vnder the ſhade of theſe priuiledges; we ſhall in the end finde that our countrie was neuer ſo famous in the fruition of Gods manifold mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as it ſhall be infamous and reproched through the fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe of our ſins, and the fearefulneſſe of Gods vengeance, which he will execute amongſt vs.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The reaſon why this ſin is ſo ſtraitly forbidden and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, is, becauſe, firſt, there can be no communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and idols, betweene his true religion and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip, idolatrie and ſuperſtition, according to that, 2. Cor. 6. 14. 15. <hi>What fellowſhip hath righteouſneſſe with vnrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? and what communion hath light with darkneſſe? and what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with the infidell? and what agreement hath the Temple of God with idols?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe the Lord is not capable of any copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip;
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:10737:317"/> for whereas there are three ſorts of men, who can abide no ſharing nor partnerſhip, a King in his kingdome, a maſter in his familie, a husband in his mariage bed; the Lord is both our King, maſter and husband. Hee is a King, yea a glorious King, Pſal. 24. and laſt verſe, and <hi>he will not giue his</hi>

                  <hi>glorie to another,</hi> Eſay 42. 8. and therefore he will rule vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone by the ſcepter of his word, or he will thruſt vs from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his gouernment, and giue vs ouer to be ruled by the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie of Satan, and our owne corrupt wils. He is our maſter, Malac. 1. 6. who requireth all our ſeruice, or elſe will haue <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Malac.</hi> 1. 6.</note> none of it at all; becauſe we cannot performe faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to two maſters, eſpecially being of a contratie diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Matth. 6. 24. He is the husband of the Church, Eſa. 54. 5. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 24. <hi>Eſay</hi> 54. 5.</note> yea a iealous husband, who can endure no cotriuals in his loue; and therefore if ſhe will needs play the harlot with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Lord will diuorce her from him, as being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnworthie to enioy his loue.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this doctrine ſerueth to admoniſh vs, that wee <note place="margin">Wee muſt make no mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture betweene Chriſts true religion and Popiſh ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition.</note> carefully beware of making a mixture, betweene that true religion which we profeſſe, and Popiſh ſuperſtition, that is, the religion of Chriſt, and the religion of Antichriſt: for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they match, yea and far exceed euen the Gentiles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in their multitude of idols, they hauing for euery day in the yeare, &amp; for euery little village in a whole kingdome, and for euery occaſion and imployment, a ſeuerall Saint, to whom they giue diuine honor, by praying vnto them, by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting ſtatues, images and temples for their honor, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating and ſetting apart holy daies for their ſeruice, by making vowes, and offering oblations vnto them, ſeeing they worſhip the Idoll of the Maſſe, and creepe to the croſſe, and to magnifie their owne merits, extenuate the al-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent merits of Ieſus Chriſt; therefore it is as poſſible to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile truth and falſhood, light and darkneſſe, God and <hi>Belial,</hi> as Chriſtian religion with Popiſh ſuperſtition.

<pb n="303" facs="tcp:10737:318"/> expreſſed by a ſimilitude taken from an vnruly heifer, the which is here contracted, but may be thus explicated; as the heifer which is well fatted, by running in a fruitfull paſture, groweth in time ſo wanton, that ſhe contemneth her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, ſhaketh off the yoke, gaddeth abroad and skippeth ouer hedge and ditch into other paſtures, rather for wantonneſſe then for hunger; ſo the Iſraelites being fatted by Gods ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold benefits grew thereby ſo wanton and rebellious, that they deſpiſed the Lord who ſed them, ſhooke off the yoke of his gouernment, denying to ſubmit themſelues to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by his holy word, forſooke the Temple which was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Lord to be their paſture, wherein hee would feede them with his word and Sacraments, and broke into forbidden places, euen the hils, groues, and idolatrous Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, where for wantonneſſe, and not for hunger, they fedde themſelues with the poyſonous hemlocke of idolatrie and Heatheniſh ſuperſtition, refuſing in the meane time the wholeſome food of their ſoules, Gods pure and ſincere wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, whereby they ſhould haue been fed to eternall life.</p>
               <p>In which ſimilitude diuers things are implied: firſt, that the Iſraelites were contumatious and rebellious againſt the Lord, and that beyond all bounds and limits of humanitie; and therefore they are compared in their rebellion not with reaſonable men, but with vnreaſonable beaſts, to ſhew their ſtupiditie and brutiſhnes in this their ſinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hee intimateth their audacious ſtubbornneſſe, whereby they were readie to reſiſt God to his face, in that he compareth them not to ſuch beaſts as ſhew their contempt of their maſter by their flight and running away, but to a ſtubborne and vnruly heifer, which will not only ſhake off the yoke, but alſo put at her maſter with her hornes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, here is implied their vnruly wantonneſſe, which would not ſuffer them to continue in one and the ſame Church with the Iewes, as it were in one heard and one pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, but cauſed them after a wilde faſhion to ſeuer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues from the reſt, and to leape as it were ouer Gods fence,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:10737:319"/> to aſſociate themſelues with the Gentiles, in their more then brutiſh idolatrie and damnable ſuperſtitions.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, hee heere intimateth their wicked abuſe of Gods bleſſings, wherewith being as it were fatted and pampered to the full, they did not only vngratefully forget and forſake the Lord, but alſo rebelliouſly caſt off the yoke of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and ſtubbornely oppoſed his will, and as it were in ſauage and brutiſh manner made head againſt him.</p>

                     <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 1.</note> from conſorting with the idolatrous Iſraelites. The ſecond argument is taken from their puniſhment, in theſe words; <hi>Now the Lord will feed them as a lambe in a large place.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is ſignified, that the Lord would bring vpon the people of Iſrael all kinde of miſerable calamities, in the land of their captiuitie, wherewith he would tame their ſtubborne vnru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, and humble their haughtie pride.</p>
               <pb n="305" facs="tcp:10737:319"/>
               <p> But let vs deſcend vnto more particulars. In this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here threatned two things are to be conſidered: firſt, the time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſhould be inflicted: ſecondly, the puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it ſelfe. The time is expreſſed in the preſent tenſe: <hi>Now the Lord will feede them.</hi> Whereby is ſignified, that ſeeing they were growen to ſuch haughtie ſtubbornneſſe, in their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, God would no longer indure it, but would take a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die courſe to abate their pride, maſter their vnruly ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and to tame their wantonneſſe, by loading them as it were with calamities.</p>
               <p>The puniſhment it ſelfe is expreſſed by way of allegorie: for as before he had ſignified their vnrulineſſe and rebellion, by a ſimilitude of an vnruly heifer, ſo now he ſetteth downe their abiect and miſerable condition, vnder the ſimilitude of a ſillie wandring lambe in a deſert place. As though hee ſhould ſay, Becauſe whileſt I fed them plentifully with my benefits, they behaued themſelues like wanton, ſtubborne and vnruly beaſts; I will out of hand ſtrip them of my gifts, wherewith they are too much pampered, and ſo loade them with miſeries and calamities, that they ſhall become as mild and tame as ſillie lambes, wandring in the wilderneſſe, and forſaken both of damme and ſhepheard.</p>
               <p>By which ſimilitude the Prophet doth in moſt liuely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner decipher the miſerable condition of the people of Iſrael; for firſt, whereas ſheepe being ſociable creatures, delight in companie, and loue to be in the flocke; it is vnto them irk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and tedious, when being ſtraied from the reſt, they wander alone in deſert places: but ſuch tediouſneſſe of life the Lord threatneth againſt the Iſraelites; for ſeeing they would not aſſociate themſelues with the reſt of his flocke, the people of Iuda, nor would bee content to be infolded in his Temple, as it were in their ſafe ſheepfould; but behaued themſelues rather like wanton heifers, then like the Lords ſheep, taking delight in gadding from the reſt of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie and leaping into forbidden paſtures; therefore the Lord threatneth, that ſeeing through wantonneſſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in ſeparation, he would ſo ſcatter them amongſt the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:10737:320"/> Heathen, that they ſhould not haue any flock to ioine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vnto, nor no fellowſhip or communion one with an other, but ſhould become like ſingle ſheepe, ſcattered here and there in vaſt and deſert places. And this is implied whereas hee vſeth the ſingular number, ſaying that they ſhould be feede, not as lambes flocking together, but as a lambe ſeuered from the reſt of his companie.</p>
               <p>Againe, the good and ſaferie of the ſillie lambe herein conſiſteth, when as hee is vnder the gouernment and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his carefull ſhepheard, and may ſatisfie his hunger, either by ſucking his damme, or by nibling the ſweet graſſe in a pleaſant paſture: on the other ſide, no greater miſerie can befall the ſillie lambe, then to be forſaken of the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, abandoned of the damme, and to goe wandring in the wilderneſſe, amongſt wolues and other ſauage beaſts, eſpecially being ſillie and ſimple in wit, vnable to make any ſhift by policie to eſcape danger, feeble and weake, not able to make reſiſtance againſt the leaſt violence; and ſlow of pace, hauing no hope to ſaue himſelfe by flight. For what can the poore lambe doe in this caſe, but wander vp and downe, fearing euery ſhadow, and trembling at euery noiſe, till he haue ſpent his ſtrength with bleating and crying for hopeleſſe helpe, or is pined with hunger, or is made a pray of ſome rauenous beaſt? But this the Lord threatneth ſhould be the condition of the rebellious Iſraelites; for becauſe they would not bee ruled by him their louing and carefull ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, hee excluded them out of his fould, and thruſt them from vnder his gouernment and protection; becauſe they deſpiſed their mother the true Church, he ſeuers and ſcatters them from her, ſo as they could not any longer ſucke her breaſts, nor receiue the milke of the word and Sacraments, for the relieuing their ſpirituall hunger; becauſe they could not be content to liue in that fruitfull paſture the land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, but like vnruly heifers tooke their chiefe pleaſure in ranging abroad, hee threatneth that hee would prouide a place for them large enough, for they ſhould haue the whole world to wander in, after they were led into captiuity, where
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:10737:320"/> their commons ſhould be no leſſe hard then full of danger; for it ſhould not be vnto them like the land of Iſrael and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, which was like a pleaſant paſture, hedged about on eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſide, with the ſtrong fence of Gods mightie power, and euer watching prouidence; but like a vaſt and deſert wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which being drie and barren, ſhould affoord vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but bare and ſlender prouiſion to ſuſtaine their liues; and being full of cruell and wicked men, as it were with ſo many wolues, beares, tigres, and lions, ſhould giue vnto them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall cauſe of feare, of being deuoured and deſtroyed, both in reſpect of their rauenous rage, and powerfull malice; and alſo their owne feeble weakneſſe in making any reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>And this alſo was an effectuall argument to diſſwade the men of Iuda, from aſſociating themſelues with the wicked Iſraelites, ſeeing if they were copartners with them in their defection and rebellion, forſaking Gods true Church, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and religion, to ioyne with them in their apoſtaſie, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and idolatrie, they ſhould alſo participate with them in all theſe calamities and grieuous miſeries.</p>
               <p>And thus much for the meaning of the words. The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The Do∣ctrines. </seg>
                  </label> which ariſe out of them are diuers. Firſt, generally we may here obſerue, that as by nature we are inclinable to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <note place="margin">That we are hardly drawne from bad com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany when we are intangled with it.</note> bad companie, ſo when wee are once intangled with it, wee are hardly drawne from it, with the beſt arguments and moſt effectuall diſſwaſions. An example hereof wee haue in this place; for when the people of Iuda had found a wicked ſweetneſſe in the ſocietie of the idolatrous Iſraelites, they were hardly drawne from frequenting their companie, and therefore the Lord thought it neceſſarie by his Prophet, to vſe ſo many forcible reaſons, ſome whereof are taken from the hainouſnes of their ſinnes, and ſome from the grieuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of their puniſhments, to diſſwade the men of Iuda from haunting the impions fellowſhip of the Iſraelites. So how often and earneſtly did the Lord charge the people of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, when they entred into the land of promiſe, not to make any couenant, not to haue any ſocietie with the inhabitants of the land? as wee may ſee, Exod. 23. 32.

                     <hi>Iud.</hi> 1. 28. 2. 1. 2</note> ſaid of <hi>Lot</hi> and his wife, who were ſo bewitched with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Sodome, that they would not leaue that wicked co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, though they had ſtrong inducements ſo to doe, both in reſpect that their ſins were moſt outragious, as alſo in that <note place="margin">

Yea and when God had abſolutely told them, that hee would deſtroy So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and was now purpoſely come to execute his fierce wrath vpon them, yet they made ſuch ſlow haſte to depart, that the Angell of the Lord was faine to vſe a kinde of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. 16. 26</note> violence, and by ſtrong hand to draw them out of the citie. And after they were eſcaped the danger, though they had a direct prohibition from God, yet <hi>Lots</hi> wiſe looked backe, as being loth to depart, and longing to returne into this ſincke of ſinne. So how miſerably was good <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> inſnared in that euill fellowſhip with <hi>Ahab</hi> and his familie, in as much as neither their horrible idolatries, and hainous wickedneſſe, nor Gods fearefull iudgements threatned and inflicted vpon them, could weane him from their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, <note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 22. 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>King.</hi> 8. 18 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. 35 36.</note> nor reſtraine him from entring into the neereſt contracts and alliances with them, to the vtter corrupting and peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his houſe?</p>
               <p>Now the cauſe hereof is partly the corruption of our own <note place="margin">The fleſh and wicked world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings are in neere allia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</note> fleſh, the greateſt and worſt part of our ſelues, which, whileſt we continue here, holdeth great correſpondence and neere familiaritie with the world and wicked worldlings; and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe wicked men haue many worldly baits of pleaſure, and profit, which like <hi>Circe</hi> her poyſonous potions, doe ſo bewitch vs, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we haue no power at all to flee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this wicked fellowſhip.

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:10737:321"/> to rob vs of our ſpirituall ſtrength, and then we are eaſilie ſurprized of our ſpirituall enemies, and haue the eyes of our vnderſtanding ſo blinded, that we cannot ſee either the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe of their behauiour, or the fearefull plagues which hang ouer their heads; nor haue any power or deſire to make any euaſion out of their pleaſing thraldome, vntill the Lord repaire our ſtrength by his holy Spirit, and worke in our hearts a true hatred of their wicked tyrannie.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is, that we learne hereby to hate the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie <note place="margin">We muſt ſhun the company of wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> of wicked men, as well when they ſmile, as when they frowne, when they flatter and allure, as when they threaten and offer violence: ſeeing when they moſt fawne vpon vs, they moſt defile vs; they mortally ſtab vs, whileſt they kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embrace vs; and whileſt they are entred into moſt friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly parlies of peace and loue, they are vndermining our State, and plotting treacherous treaſons againſt both our ſoules and bodies: eſpecially let vs bee carefull to withſtand their firſt allurements, and turne away our eyes from their inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing baites, and euen ſtoppe our eares againſt theſe Syrens ſongs, before wee heare their charming notes: for if this worldly birdiime of wicked company, haue once taken hold of vs, like ſillie birds the more we ſtriue, the more we ſhall be inuegled and made vnfit to flie from them; and if we do but giue them audience, they will ſo allure vs with their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching tunes, that we ſhall haue no power to withhold vs from their company, though Syren-like they entice vs to come amongſt them, that they may deuour and prey vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vs.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing to be heere obſerued, is, that both the <note place="margin">The ſins and puniſhments of wicked me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhould weane vs from their company.</note> ſinnes and puniſhments of wicked men, ſhould be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reaſons to diſſwade the faithfull from frequenting their company; for theſe are the arguments which the holy Ghoſt here vſeth, to diſſwade the men of Iuda from reſorting vnto the Iſraelites, becauſe they were rebelliouſly ſtubborne in their ſinnes, and like vnrulie heifers had ſhaken off the yoke of gouernment, and becauſe by theſe ſinnes they had made themſelues liable to Gods fearefull puniſhments of captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:10737:322"/> and manifold calamities, which in ſhort time ſhould bee inflicted on them. Concerning the former, we are not to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of all ſinnes, for then we ſhould auoid all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie in the world, for as much as all men are ſinners; but only of ſuch ſinnes as being wilfully committed, are alſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately defended. For when men are come to this paſſe, that they commit their ſinnes againſt their knowledge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, preſumptuouſly and with an high hand againſt God, and that after they haue been often inſtructed, admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and rebuked, both in priuate conference, and in the publike miniſtrie of the Word; when they become like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulie heifers, ſtubbornely caſting off the yoke of Gods go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and do in rebellious manner oppoſe againſt God himſelfe, defending their ſinnes, and glorying in their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, as the Iſraelites did in this place; then are wee care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to flee and auoid all manner of familiar friendſhip, and fellowſhip with them. For firſt, whereas the maine end, why we ſhould reſort into the companie of wicked men, is, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct, admoniſh and rebuke them, that ſo we may reclaime them from their wicked waies, and conuert them vnto God; for which purpoſe our Sauiour kept company with publicans and ſinners; this end is taken away through their contemptuous ſtubbornenſſe, and obſtinate contempt of all theſe holy meanes of their conuerſion: for here our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſts rule taketh place, that wee muſt not caſt holy things vnto dogs, nor pearles before ſwine, leſt they treade theſe precious iewels vnder their filthie feet, and turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine all to rent vs, as it is, Matth. 7. 6. And his example al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 6.</note> ſerueth for our direction, for when the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies, obſtinately oppoſed againſt the meanes of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, and rebelliouſly ſet themſelues againſt Gods reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will, he giueth ouer their company, and conſorteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with publicans and ſinners. And ſecondly when there is no hope of conuerting them from their ſinnes, in regard of their obſtinacie and ſtiffenes in rebellion, there is great feare leſt they will peruert vs in reſpect of our frailtie and faint weaknes in good courſes. And therfore as all wiſe men
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:10737:322"/> being in health, do auoid the company of thoſe who being infected with the plague, haue the markes and tokens ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing vpon them, becauſe there is great danger of their infection, but no hope of the others recouerie; ſo if wee bee endued with any ſparke of ſpirituall wiſdome, we will care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully auoid thoſe, who are deeply infected with the contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſeaſes of ſinne, eſpecially when as by their ſtubborne contemning of all holy admonitions and wholeſome repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, they euidently ſhew that they are marked to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and haue the plaine tokens of reprobation appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vpon them, ſeeing there is more danger that we ſhal be infected by their contagion, then there is hope that they ſhould be cured by our admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. And this was holy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> practiſe, as appeareth, Pſal. 26. 4. <hi>I haue not haunted with vaine perſons, neither kept company with the diſſemblers.</hi> 5. <hi>I haue hated the aſſemblie of the euil, and haue not companied with the wicked.</hi> And Pſal. 119. 115. <hi>Away from me you wicked, for</hi>

               <p>Again, the imminent danger of Gods fearful puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, which hang ouer the heads of wicked men, ſhould be an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall reaſon to perſwade the faithfull to auoid their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, ſeeing that as the Lord doth often ſpare the wicked for the godlies ſake, as appeareth, Gen. 18. 32. ſo hee doth ſometimes inflict temporall puniſhments vpon the faithful, becauſe they are in the companie of vngodly men, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the example of <hi>Lot,</hi> conſorting himſelfe with the <note place="margin">

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:10737:323"/> towards God, and their extreme follie in regard of themſelues. For if they had any true loue of God, or zeale of his glorie, they would not be familiar with thoſe that hate him, nor yet grace ſuch graceleſſe impes with their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, who ſpend their whole liues to his diſhonor; and if they had any dramme of true wiſdome, to prouide for their owne ſafetie, they would not range the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in the forlorne hope, nor venture their liues in that ſhip which is readie to ſinck; nor ioyne themſelues with ſuch wicked companions, who hauing committed high treaſon againſt the great King of heauen and earth, are daily in danger to bee attached, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and led to execution.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we may here obſerue, that cuſtomable liuing in <note place="margin">Cuſtomable ſinning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth men bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh in their wickednes.</note> ſinne, doth make men to become, not only inhumane and barbarous, but brutiſh in wickedneſſe; and therefore it is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall with the holy Ghoſt to decipher the diſpoſition of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, by comparing them vnto brute beaſts; as in this place he ſetteth forth the ſtubborne rebellion of the Iſraelites by likening them to an vnrulie heifer, who caſting off the yoke, is readie with violence to run againſt her maſter.

               <p>Secondly, this ſheweth the malignant qualitie of ſinne, <note place="margin">The malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant qualitie of ſinners.</note> which like <hi>Circe</hi> her poyſonous potions, transformeth men into beaſts, and maketh thoſe who were created according to the moſt beautifull image of God, to be more vgly and deformed in Gods ſight, then the moſt bruitiſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and baſeſt creature. The conſideration whereof as it ſhould make vs moſt carefull in auoiding ſinne, with all the baites, allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and prouocations which incite vs thereunto; ſo when we are defiled and deformed with the foule and filthy ſpots of our tranſgreſſions, we ſhould be as carefull to applie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs the precious blood of Chriſt by a liuely faith, that thereby being cleanſed and purged, we may be reſtored to our former beautie and perfection.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we may here obſerue, that when a people pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing <note place="margin">Thoſe who will not ſerue God, ſhall be made ſlaues to their enemies.</note> religion, doe caſt off the yoke of Gods gouernment, and in the pride and ſtubborneſſe of their hearts contemne all meanes of their conuerſion, then the iudgements of God lie waiting at the dore, and are readie to enter vpon them; and becauſe they will not ſubmit themſelues to be ruled by the ſcepter of Gods kingdome, he will thruſt them from vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his protection, cauſe them to be led into captiuitie, and ſuffer their enemies to tyrrannize &amp; inſult ouer them. So in this place, becauſe the Iſraelites were become like vnrulie Heifers, and would not beare the yoke of Gods gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he threatneth that they ſhould become the captiues and ſlaues of their enemies, and vnder their tyrannical thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:10737:324"/> indure manifold miſeries and calamities. Many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples might be brought to cleare this point. In the time of the Iudges, when the people rebelled againſt the Lord, contemned his word, and denied him their ſeruice and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance, hee gaue them ouer into the hands of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as the Canaanites, Midianites, Philiſtines, and diuers others. When the Iewes would not ſerue the Lord their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne King, hee made them ſerue tyrannicall Lords in a ſtrange countrie, both before and ſince the comming of Chriſt. When <hi>Manaſſes</hi> and <hi>Zedechias</hi> would not regard the word of the Lord, but perſecuted his Prophets, and made warre as it were againſt Heauen, the Lord pulled downe their pride, and broke their ſtubborne and rebellious hearts with the manifold calamities of a miſerable captiuitie. And this is that which the Lord threatneth againſt the rebellious potentates of the earth, who in furious rage combined themſelues againſt the kingdome of Ieſus Chriſt; namely, that he would vexe them in his ſore diſpleaſure: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not be ruled by the ſcepter of his word, he would craſh them with his ſcepter of yron, and breake them in peeces like a potters veſſell, Pſalm. 2. 2. 5. 9. So our <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>And ſurely this is iuſt with God, that thoſe who deny vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him their obedience and allegeance, which is the Lords lawfull right, both in reſpect of their creation, continuall preſeruation, and of thoſe manifold benefits which they haue receiued vnder his gouernement, ſhould be vſed as rebellious traitors, and feele the extreameſt rigour of his righteous lawes; that thoſe who will not bee ruled by the ſcepter of his word, ſhould be cut off with the ſword of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; and that they who will not ſerue their gracious Lord, who richly rewardeth their imperfect ſeruice, with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſerued wages of both temporall benefits in this life, and eternall glorie in the life to come, ſhould in their bodies be
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:10737:324"/> yeelded vp to the tyrannicall gouernement of their inſolent enemies, who will reward their ſeruice with iniuries, indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and manifold calamities, and both in bodie and ſoule, become the vaſſals and ſlaues of ſinne, Satan, the world, and their owne vnrulie luſts, whoſe wages is eternall death, after a wretched and miſerable life.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is, that we labour to conforme our ſelues in holy obedience vnto the will of our heauenly King, and ſubmit our ſelues to be ruled by the ſcepter of his word; and then he will keepe vs vnder his protection, defend vs from the malice and furie of all our enemies, and greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich vs with his bleſſings and benefits. Whereas on the other ſide, if we deny vnto him our allegeance, he will take no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther charge of vs, but will lay vs open to the common ſpoyle; if we be proude he will finde meanes to humble vs, if ſtubborne and vnrulie, he will take a ſpeedie courſe to tame and rule vs; and if like vntamed heifers, we ſhake off the yoke of his gouernement which is light and eaſie, hee can hamper vs well enough, by laying vpon our neckes the yron yoke of our tyrannical enemies, which will gall vs not onely to the quicke, but euen to the heart.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, wee may here obſerue, how wretched and miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">The miſerable eſtate of thoſe who are thruſt from vnder Gods protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> their eſtate is, who for their rebellious ſtubburnneſſe, are thruſt from vnder Gods gouernement and protection. For they ſhall be as a lambe in a large place: that is; as the poore lambe is in a moſt deſperate condition, which wandreth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in ſome vaſt wilderneſſe, without any ſheepheard to tend &amp; defend him, or damme to feed him, in danger either of pining, or of deuouring; ſo alike wretched is their eſtate, who for their ſtubburnneſſe and vnrulineſſe, are thruſt out of Chriſts ſheepfold, from vnder his gouernement and prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For whereas whileſt they were at his guiding, hee led them into his greene paſtures, feeding them with his ſweete milke, and pleaſant graſſe of his word and Sacraments; now they are depriued of this food of their ſoules, &amp; ſo ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pined and ſtarued: whereas he fenced them in, and kept them from wandring, with the ſtrong hedges of his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:10737:325"/> and gentle chaſtiſements; now the fence being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, they ſtray abroad, and wander vp and downe in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of this world, both pinched with want of all ſpirituall foode, and expoſed to all maner of deſperate danger: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as whileſt they were vnder his direction, they were vnder his protection alſo; who by his prouidence and power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended them from worldly wolues, and beares, and from that ramping and roaring Lion, &amp; fierce red Dragon Satan, who daily aſſailed and earneſtly laboured to deuoure them: now being diſarmed of his aſſiſtance, they lie open to the common ſpoile, being altogether vnable either to ſlie away, or make reſiſtance. And this was the ſtate of the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious ſheepe, our great grandfather <hi>Adam,</hi> when as by his <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 7.</note> ſinne he had made himſelfe naked: this was the caſe of the Lords flocke, the people of Iſrael, when as they alſo had <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 25.</note> made themſelues naked by their idolatry, whileſt they were in the wilderneſſe; and into this condition they often brought themſelues in the time of the Iudges. For howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer whileſt they ſerued the Lord, they had proſperitie, peace, plentie of all things, and were ſo hedged in on all ſides, that all their enemies could not hurt them; yet when as they made a deſection from vnder his gouernment, and for their grieuous ſinnes were diſarmed of his protection, how ſpeedily did their enemies inuade them? how ſharply did they aſſault them? and how eaſily did they pray vpon them? And finally when they made no end of prouoking the Lord to anger by their ſinnes, how miſerably were they ſcattered like ſheepe without a ſhepheard, and made a pray to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage beaſts, the cruell Heathens; as the Lord threatneth in this place?</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we carefully keep our ſelues in Gods ſafe ſheepfold and pleaſant paſture, the true Church, and attentiuely hearken, and diligently obey the voyce of our great ſhepheard, and ſo wee ſhall not only be ſafe vnder his protection, but alſo be plentifully fedde with his abundant bleſſings. Otherwiſe, if we leaue our ſheepiſh nature, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come vnruly like vntamed heifers, the Lord will let vs range

               <p>ANd thus much in generall concerning the ſinnes of the Iſraelites, namely, their ſtubborne rebellion; which the Prophet vſeth as an argument, to diſſwade the men of Iuda, from aſſociating themſelues with them. In the next place he doth more ſpecially expreſſe the particular ſinnes, which moſt raigned amongſt them, the which are of two ſorts: firſt, their ſins againſt the firſt table, in this verſe: and ſecondly, their ſinnes againſt the ſecond table, in the verſe following. Their ſinne againſt the firſt table was their idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, in theſe words, Verſ. 17. <hi>Ephraim is ioyned to idols:</hi> 
                  <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>let him alone.</hi> Which words containe two things: firſt, a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <note place="margin">The expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</note> to diſſwade the men of Iuda from accompanying the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, in theſe words, <hi>Ephraim is ioyned to idols:</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly a repetition of the generall dehortation, whereby it is reenforced, in the words following, <hi>let him alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the former: here by <hi>Ephraim</hi> we are Synec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dochically to vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the ten Tribes of Iſrael, which made a defection from the houſe of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and ioyned with <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam.</hi> But <hi>Ephraim</hi> one of the ten, is here and elſewhere prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally named: firſt, becauſe it was at this time chiefe of all the reſt, both in honor and wealth. Secondly, he nameth <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi> only, to vpbraide his vnthankfulnes, in that hee had abuſed Gods extraordinarie mercie towards him; for wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he had of the meere mercie and loue of God, receiued the preheminence before his elder brother <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> in his great grandfather <hi>Iacobs</hi> bleſſing, and the priuiledge of the birthright, the which alſo the Lord verified by the euent, this ſhould haue moued him to extraordinarie thankfulnes and obedience; he contrariwiſe did not onely himſelfe make a fearefull defection from God, and his pure religion, but pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted alſo the whole kingdome with his ſuperſtition &amp; ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, and became the head, and firſt mouer of this horrible Apoſtaſie. Laſtly, he here nameth <hi>Ephraim,</hi> rather then any other Tribe, becauſe <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Nebat,</hi> and other
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:10737:326"/> idolatrous Kings, which were the ſetters vp, and maintainers of idolatrie, were herehence deſcended; ſo that as hereby he taxeth the whole Tribe, as being principall ringleaders to idolatrie, ſo eſpecially the Kings &amp; Nobles of this Tribe, which by their authoritie, example, and practiſe, drew not only them, but the other Tribes alſo, to idolatrie and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition.</p>
               <p>It is further added, that this <hi>Ephraim</hi> is ioyned to idols: the word ſignifieth a continued act of time, namely, as they had in former times, ſo they continued to ioyne themſelues to their idols: where he vnderſtandeth ſuch a ioyning and coniunction, as is betweene the fornicatour and the harlot, who by their whoredome ſo ioyne together, as that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one fleſh: implying hereby that they and their idols were vnited together, in ſuch a neere and inſeparable knot, that there was ſcarce any poſſibilitie, that they would euer admit of any diſunion and ſeparation.</p>
               <p>And this was the maner of their coniunction. The things <note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> to which they were ioyned, were their idols. The word here vſed, is deriued from an Hebrew roote, which ſignifieth ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, griefe, and terror, and therefore <hi>Iunius</hi> tranſlateth it, <hi>Coniunctus est terriculis Ephraim,</hi> wherby is implied that the worſhipping and ſeruing of idols, neuer bringeth any ſound comfort, peace of conſcience, or cheerefull deuotion, but griefe and ſeruile feare, anxietie and trouble of mind.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of the firſt part of this verſe. Now vpon this reaſon alledged, the former dehortation is vrged and inforced, in theſe words, <hi>Let them alone.</hi> The which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned Expoſitors vnderſtand, as the ſpeech of God to the Prophet; as though the Lord ſeeing the ſtubborne peruerſnes of the people, who by no meanes would bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, ſhould enioyne his Prophet to ſurceaſe his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and to giue them ouer as being a deſperate cure. But I rather take it, to bee the ſpeech of the Prophet himſelfe to the people of Iuda, diſſwading them from intermedling with the Iſraelites, becauſe they were ſuch groſſe idolaters, as were now become paſt hope of amendment. And I thus
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:10737:326"/> expound it: firſt, becauſe the maine drift of this ſecond part of the chapter, is to diſſwade the men of Iuda from aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelues with the idolatrous Iſraelites; and therefore as in the 15. verſe, he dehorted them from comming into their company, ſo now he admoniſheth them not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle, or haue any dealings with them. And ſecondly we ſee, that after this reſtraint, the Prophet ſtill continueth his labours in the worke of his miniſterie, which hee would not haue done, had the Lord by his prohibition enioyned him to deſiſt; for it is a fault to fight, when the Lord ſoundeth the retraite, as well as to ſtand ſtill, or flee backe when hee ſoundeth the alarum to battell. And <hi>Hoſea</hi> ſhould haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, if hee had preached, when the Lord had enioyned him ſilence, as well as <hi>Ionas</hi> in detracting his labours, and in not ſpeaking that which God had put into his mouth, when he ſent him on his meſſage: although I deny not, but that the Lord doth ſometimes vſe rhetorical and ſemblable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions in this kind, not that he would haue the euent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with the outward letter, but to put the ſecure people in mind of the deſperateneſſe of their condition, and to awake them out of their ſpiritual lethargie; but I ſee no reaſon why we ſhould run to figures, when the plaine ſenſe better accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with the ſcope of the place.</p>
               <p>The meaning then is, that Iuda ſhould let the Iſraelites a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and haue no manner of familiaritie, or entercourſe of dealing with them. For whereas they might pretend, that they therfore conuerſed with them, that by their admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they might reclaime them from their idolatrie: hee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away this obiection, by ſhewing that they were ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately addicted to their idols, and ſo as it were glewed vnto, and incorporated with them, that there was no hope of any ſeparation; and therefore ſeeing there was no likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of their reclaiming, it was the beſt courſe not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with them; for well might they make them worſe, but it was not like they could make the other better; well might they allure them to communicate with them in their ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, but it was ſcarce poſſible to diſſwade them from
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:10737:327"/> their idolatrous and falſe worſhip. Againe, as our Sauiour ſaith in another caſe, they had <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 16.</note> booke of Gods law, &amp; faithfull Expoſitors to make it cleare to their vnderſtandings, and to admoniſh them of their euill waies, and therefore it was likely, if they would not giue them the hearing, then much leſſe would they regard their priuate admonitions.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of the words. The doctrines <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The do∣ctrines. </seg>
                  </label> which ariſe out of them are theſe. Firſt, we here learne, that the greatnes of thoſe that offend, either in reſpect of honor, <note place="margin">The greatnes of the ſinner doth aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate the ſinne.</note> power, riches or other Gods bleſſings, doth not take away or extenuate the fault, guilt or puniſhment of ſinne, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth increaſe and aggrauate them. Becauſe <hi>Ephraim</hi> was the principall Tribe amongſt the ten, and moſt abounded with all maner of Gods bleſſings; therefore in the firſt place he is accuſed, as being more ſinful, then all the other Tribes, and in the generall inditement, hee beareth the name of all his confederates, as being in reſpect of his greatneſſe, more guiltie of ſinne then any of his brethren. So becauſe the Lord had aduanced the people of Iſrael, aboue all the nations round about them, and had priuiledged them with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie bleſſings, both temporall and ſpiritual aboue al their neighbour countries, therefore their ſinnes and rebellions were much more haynous and abominable in Gods ſight, and their puniſhments much more grieuous, as appeareth, Ezech. 5. 5. 6. 9. 10. In theſe reſpects alſo the Prophet mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 5. 5. 6. 9. 10. <hi>&amp; cap</hi> 6.</note> them, yea and giueth them the preheminence in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, aboue Sodome it ſelfe; eſpecially in that they had abuſed Gods more rich mercie, and wilfully withſtood the meanes of their conuerſion and ſaluation, which the other wanted, as he ſheweth at large, Ezech. 16.</p>
               <p>And ſurely not without reaſon, are thoſe to be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as the moſt grieuous malefactours, who being moſt highly aduanced by God in the fruition of all his gifts and bleſſings, do notwithſtanding diſhonor him by their ſinnes, and with an high hand rebell againſt him. Firſt, becauſe to their other ſinnes, they adde horrible ingratitude, a vice odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:10737:327"/> to God and man: for whereas Gods bountie ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to dutie and obedience, they forgetting or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the author of their preferment, abuſe his owne gifts to his diſhonour: and like vnthankfull rebels being aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and inriched by their Soueraigne, vſe all their credit, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and wealth to ſtrengthen them in their rebellion. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, becauſe thoſe who are aduanced aboue others, in honour, power, and riches, are ſeated as it were vpon a hill, and in the eye of all men, whereby it commeth to paſſe that their ſinnes are exemplarie, and ſo they doe not only offend God themſelues, but alſo draw others to imitate their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes; and hereby their ſingle ſinnes are doubled and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled vpon their ſinfull ſoules, according to the number of thoſe who are corrupted by their euill example.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof ſerueth to ſtirre vp all whom the Lord hath <note place="margin">The more we are aduanced, the more ſhould be our thankfulnes.</note> aduanced aboue others in his bleſſings, that they earneſtly labour to exceede others in thankfulnes and obedience. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe if they being vnmindfull of Gods benefits rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and diſhonour his name by their ſinnes; they ſhall be condemned and puniſhed not only as ordinarie ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but alſo as vngratefull rebels, and as chiefe captaines and ringleaders, who by their example haue drawne others into the like tranſgreſſions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, thoſe who are of a meane eſtate may here learne <note place="margin">The ſmalnes of our receits cauſeth ſhort accounts.</note> contentation, ſeeing by the ſmalneſſe of their receits, they haue the benefit of ſhort accounts; and the lower their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is, the more they are priuiledged from the guilt of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens ſinnes. For whereas thoſe who are in eminent pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are expoſed much more to the boiſterous ſtormes of manifold tentations, and when they fall like high buildings beate downe inferiours, as it were vnder cottages, with their ruines; thoſe who are but of meane qualitie, doe not lie ſo open to theſe blaſts of triall; or though they be ouerthrown in the day of tentation, yet commonly they are only guiltie of their owne fall, there being few or none that by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample are drawne into their ſinne.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we here obſerue, that ſuch is the neere coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:10737:328"/> betweene idolaters and their idols, that they moſt <note place="margin">The neere coniunction betweene ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters &amp; their idols.</note> hardly admit of any ſeparation: for as in corporall fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the adulterer is ſo ioyned with the adultereſſe, that they become one fleſh; whereby it commeth to paſſe, that they ſo deſperatly dote one vpon another, that neither the loſſe of their credit, nor the impoueriſhing of their eſtate, nor the manifold miſchiefes which accompanied their ſinnes in this life, nor the eternall torments of hell fire, which are threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt adulterers in the life to come, can weane them one from another; ſo in this ſpirituall whoredome, the ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later doth in his hart and affections ſo cleaue vnto his idols, that he neglecteth his fame and reputation with the godly, conſumeth his wealth and ſubſtance, contemneth Gods hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie iudgements denounced againſt idolaters, both in this life and the life to come. And this was the eſtate of <hi>Ephraim</hi> in this place, who ſo firmely cleaued vnto their idols, that they could by no meanes be ſeuered, neither by Gods allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring promiſes, nor terrifying threats, neither by his mercies, nor by his iudgements, neither by the publike preaching of Gods Prophets, nor by the priuate admonitions of their brethren; and therefore the Lord commandeth the men of Iuda, not to intermeddle with them, as being now become a deſperate cure, of whom there was no hope of amendment and reformation. Many ſuch examples we haue in the book of God. Although <hi>Laban</hi> long enioyed the companie of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie <hi>Iacob,</hi> and plainly ſaw the manifold bleſſings which the true <hi>Iehouah</hi> multiplied vpon him, yea and vpon himſelfe alſo for <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſake; yet all this could not withdraw him from worſhipping his idols. So although the Lord made choice of the Iſraelites for his peculiar people, and gaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them his law, wherein he preſcribed his true worſhip, and reſtrained them from idolatrie, and confirmed this law by powerfull miracles, and by continuall experience gaue them to vnderſtand, that he bleſſed them with all his benefits whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they worſhipped him according to his reuealed will, and contrariwiſe multiplied his plagues vpon them, when they worſhipped idols; yet ſo wholly were they poſſeſſed with a
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:10737:328"/> ſpirit of fornications, that all this would not reſtraine them from this ſin, nor reclaime them from their idolatrie, when they had addicted themſelues vnto it. So although the Lord had puniſhed the land of Iuda with captiuitie and deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and had ſent his Prophets vnto them that remained, to aſcertaine them that their idolatrie was the chiefe cauſe of all their miſeries, yet they rebelliouſly contemne the word of the Lord, and deſperately reſolue to continue in their idolatrie, Iere. 44. 16. 17. 21. 22.

And euen in our owne daies doe wee not ſee that the idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Papiſts hauing wedded themſelues to their ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will by no meanes admit of any diuorce and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but ſhutting their eyes againſt the light of Gods truth, and hardening their hearts againſt all thoſe holy precepts whereby idolatrie and ſuperſtition is forbidden and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, impudently perſiſt in their euill courſes, chuſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to raſe out that which was written by Gods owne fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and to mangle and maime the commandements of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, which prohibite the making and worſhipping of images, then to ſuffer their idolatrous ſuperſtitions to bee rooted out of their hearts, or to admit of any diuiſion or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration betweene them and their idols?</p>
               <p>The vſe of this doctrine is, that when any are ſuiters vnto <note place="margin">We muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of idolatrie.</note> vs in the behalfe of idols for our loue, we giue them a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die anſwere, and forbid the banes when they are firſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, alleaging for our ſelues, that wee are alreadie married to our husband Chriſt, and therefore cannot entertaine their loue, vnleſſe wee would become notorious ſtrumpets; that we haue alreadie receiued Chriſt into our hearts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no place there for idols, ſeeing there can bee no communion betweene them; that we are the temples of the holy Ghoſt, which hath no agreement with idols, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh, 2.

Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſuch is the inclinableneſſe of our hearts to idolatrie and ſuperſtition, and in ſo neere a bond of loue is corrupted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and our fleſhly part vnited with idols, that if wee giue way to the firſt motions, and ſuffer our hearts and affections to be ioyned with them, the knot betweene vs will prooue inſeparable, and no perſwaſions will withdraw vs from them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wee here learne from the name which the holie <note place="margin">Idolatrie and ſuperſtition. bringeth no true comfort, but horror and anxietie.</note> Ghoſt giueth vnto idols, that they doe not giue vnto thoſe who are deuoted to their ſeruice any true comfort, or ſound ioy, or peace of conſcience, but contrariwiſe, horrour and ſcare, diſquietnes of minde, and iuſt cauſe of griefe and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, in reſpect of the manifold miſeries &amp; calamities which they bring to both ſoule, bodie, and ſtate in this life and the life to come. For whereas thoſe who ſerue the Lord the Prince of peace and God of all conſolation, may certainly expect from him peace of conſcience, in the middeſt of all wordly garboyles, and true comfort when they are compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed about with all calamities; contrariwiſe they who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip idols, ſerue Satan the prince of terror and feare, who continually tormenteth his vaſſals with perplexed mindes, and troubled conſciences, and draweth them to their deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by dreadfull apparitions, and affrighting terrors, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no ground to giue vnto them whereupon they may build any ſound co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort. Wheras thoſe who truly ſerue God according to his reuealed will, may ſecurely expect helpe in the time of trouble, and protection and deliuerance in the time of danger, becauſe hee is omniſcient and knoweth our eſtates, omnipotent, and can relieue vs, &amp; moſt kind and gratious, and will not withdraw his helping hand when we ſtand in need: contrariwiſe theſe idols are blind and cannot
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:10737:329"/> ſee vs, impotent and cannot helpe vs, without any loue, yea without reaſon, ſenſe, and life, and therefore regard vs not when we moſt implore their aide. Of the former we haue an example in <hi>Elias,</hi> who worſhipping the true God in a true maner, was heard of God, magnified in the ſight of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by an admirable miracle, and protected and deliuered in the middeſt of all dangers; of the others in <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, <note place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 18.</note> who by worſhipping their idoll, got nothing but wounds to their bodies, anguiſh and perplexitie to their minds and ſoules, and vtter deſtruction to them both. The like reward had <hi>Ieroboam, Ahab,</hi> and the reſt of the idolatrous Kings, for their zealous deuotions, and painfull ſeruice which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to their idols.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this doctrine is that, which the Apoſtle <hi>Iohn</hi> teacheth vs, 1.

And this wee ſhall do, if we reſiſt and withſtand the firſt beginnings and degrees of idolatrie, and in Gods worſhip and ſeruice ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelues to be guided by the ſtraight line of his holy word, neither declining on the right hand, nor on the left; or if wee haue been alreadie ſeduced, and ioyned with idols, I meane in the worſhipping of Saints, Angels, and Images, vnto which kind of idolatrie the Papiſts allure vs, both by their doctrine and example; then let vs betimes breake off this fellowſhip, whileſt yet there remaineth ſome hope of ſeparation. For if when in our heart and affections, we are firſt ioyned and glewed vnto them, we pull our ſelues aſunder with an holy violence, we ſhall finde the ſeparation almoſt as eaſily atchieued, as attempted, the vnion being greene and weake: but if we be hardened and ſtrengthened in this coniunction, by long time and cuſtome, we ſhall find that the whole wood will as eaſilie breake in ſunder, as the ioynt, and as ſoone will the bodie part with his members, and the ſoule admit of a willing diuorce from the bodie, as we being thus ioyned, may be ſeuered from idols, vnleſſe we
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:10737:330"/> be plentifully watered with the dew of Gods word, and be throughly warmed with the fire of his holy Spirit, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuppled, be made pliable to Gods will.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, wee heere learne, that when men haue long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <note place="margin">We muſt giue ouer thoſe who are paſt cure, and not intermeddle with them.</note> the meanes of their ſaluation, and are hardned in their ſins, ſo as there is no hope of doing them good, by our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admonitions, inſtructions, exhortations, and reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then are we to let them alone, and not to intermeddle with them: firſt, becauſe we ſhall expoſe Gods holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to pollution, and ſubiect them to the proude con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of rebellious and malicious men, contrarie to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of our Sauiour, Matth. 7. 6. <hi>Giue yee not that which</hi>

For ſooner will theſe incurable leapers, taint vs with their leproſie of ſinne, then we ſhall cleanſe them by our beſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued medicines; and being ſo deepely infected with the plague of wickednes, that the markes and tokens of death and deſtruction appeare vpon them, there is no ſhew of hope, that we ſhould reſtore them to their ſpirituall health, but there is great cauſe of feare leſt they infect vs with their contagion. It is true indeed, that though their peſtilent vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were apt to taint vs, yet if we were not as apt to be tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, there were no ſuch great danger; but here it is far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; for as their poiſonous contagion is fit to infect vs, ſo in reſpect of the groſſe and corrupt humours of ſinne, which remaine euen in all thoſe who are regenerate, we are as apt to receiue the infection; and therefore we haue ſmall reaſon to thruſt our ſelues into their companie, when it euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie appeareth that their diſeaſes are deſperate and paſt our cure.</p>
               <p>Againe, if we haunt the companie of wicked men, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine <note place="margin">The euils that redound to thoſe who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent euill companie.</note> neere familiaritie and friendſhip with them, either we muſt be ſilent when we ſee their faults, or elſe admoniſh

               <p>The vſe of this doctrine ſerueth to teach vs, that vnder no colour of excuſe we frequent the company of ſuch, who are ſo far ſpent in the ſickneſſe of ſinne, that there is no probable hope of their recouerie; for ſeeing they are ſtrong in euill, we weake in good; they wholly corrupt, we but in part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate; they ſtriuing with all the powers of their heart, mind and ſoule, to draw vs vnto their ſinnes, and we faintly oppoſing, either to perſwade them from their wickedneſſe, or to ſtand in our owne vprightneſſe: in a word, ſeeing wee labour againſt the ſtreame in our courſe of righteouſneſſe, and they haue both winde and tide in their courſe of ſinne, let not vs grapple with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, fooliſhly imagining that we can force them vpward, ſeeing vpon ſo much aduantage as they haue againſt vs, they are much more likely, not only to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our progreſſe in godlineſſe, but to carrie vs with them downe the ſtreame of vice and wickedneſſe.</p>

Some expound theſe words allegorically, vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding by drinke, or drunkenneſſe, that they were made ſpiritually drunken, with their vnbridled loue of ſuperſtition, and being thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſotted, they committed ſpirituall whoredome, that is, ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie without ſhame. But as I take it, allegories in expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Scriptures, are like oathes in ſpeech, neuer good, but when they are neceſſarie. Beſides, he had ſpoken of their deſperate loue towards their idols in the former verſe, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending vnder it the ſinnes of the firſt table; and therfore it is not likely, that in this breuitie of ſpeech, he doth incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and reiterate the ſame thing, but rather vſeth a new ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to diſſwade the men of Iuda from frequenting their company, namely, becauſe they were guiltie of the breaches of the ſecond table alſo; of which he giueth three inſtances, to wit, their drunkenneſſe, adulterie, and briberie, vnder which he compriſeth all the reſt.</p>
               <p>But let vs come to more particulars. <hi>Their drunkenneſſe ſtincketh,</hi> or, <hi>their drinke putrifieth and ſtincketh,</hi> as the word heere vſed ſignifieth. Which words amongſt many others, haue theſe three interpretations. Some reade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus, Their <note place="margin">Druſius in Hoſea.</note>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſignifieth to goe backe. Whereby they vnderſtand by a metonymie of the cauſe, that they were gone backe and degenerate from their firſt ſtate of integritie, and had made a defection from God: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that, Eſay 1. 22. <hi>Thy ſiluer is become droſſe, thy wine is</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

                  <hi>mixt with water.</hi> But as I take it, this doth not ſo well agree with the ſcope of the Prophet, nor fitly cohereth with the words following, as after ſhall appeare.</p>
               <p>Others reade them thus; <hi>Their wine is refractarious or</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Iunius.</note> 
                  <hi>rebellious:</hi> that is, (vnderſtanding them by the ſame metony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie) their exceſſiue drinking of wine and ſtrong drinke, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them refractarious and rebellious: according to that, Prou. 20. 1. <hi>Wine is a mocker, and ſtrong drinke is raging:</hi> that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pro.</hi> 20. 1.</note> is, it maketh men to mocke and rage. And this tranſlation is very probable: firſt, becauſe the word may well beare it; for ſtrong drinke maketh men refractary, and to runne backe, as an vnrulie heifer, when her maſter putteth on the yoke, runneth backward, and will not ſuffer the yoke to come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her necke. And thus the ſame word is vſed, Hoſea 7. 14. <note place="margin">

               <p>Laſtly, others reade them according to our tranſlation; <note place="margin">R. D. Kim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi. Comment. in Hoſ. &amp; in lib. radic. &amp; Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. in Hoſ.</note> their drunkenneſſe, or their drinke corrupteth and ſtinketh. In which ſenſe, the Prophet alludeth, to the qualitie and condition of drunken men, who gull downe ſuch exceſſiue ſtore of wine and ſtrong drinke, that their ſtomackes being not able to digeſt it, it there putrifieth, corrupteth, and ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth; and ſo they annoy the ſtanders by with their vnſauory breath, filthy belchings and vomitings; as the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> alſo ſpeaketh, Eſay 28. 8. And this interpretation I imbrace <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 28. 8.</note> aboue the reſt: firſt, becauſe the word may well beare it; for then drinke is ſaid to goe backe, when it loſeth it naturall
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:10737:332"/> vertue, degenerateth, ſowreth, and corrupteth. Secondly, becauſe, as I take it, it beſt fitteth with the ſcope of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet; which is not ſo much to ſhew the effects of theſe ſinnes, as that drinke or drunkenneſſe maketh men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly and rebellious, as to ſet forth theſe odious ſinnes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues; namely, that they were addicted to beaſtly drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, whoredome, and bribing; and therefore not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſed withall with any that made conſcience of their waies. And thus the two other ſinnes are to be vnderſtood in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, &amp; not in their effects. Laſtly, this interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is moſt familiar, ſimple, &amp; plaine, without either trope or allegorie; and therefore offreth leſſe force to the words then the other.</p>
               <p>The meaning then is, that they were addicted to this ſin of drunkenneſſe, and that in ſuch brutiſh manner, that euen their very breath was noyſome, and all their whole carriage ſo beaſtly and ſhameleſly loathſome, as that it might be an effectuall argument to weane from their company, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe amongſt the men of Iuda, who were religious, but euen all ſuch as had in them any ciuilitie or humanitie.</p>
               <p>The next ſinne which here he laieth to their charge is, that they committed whoredome; which ſome alſo vnderſtand of ſpirituall fornication &amp; idolatry: but I rather vnderſtand it of their carnall whoredome and adultery, of which they were alſo guiltie; as before appeareth, verſe 11. And ſo theſe ſinnes of drunkenneſſe and whoredome are fitly ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as the cauſe &amp; the effect: for <hi>ſine Cerere &amp; Libero fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get venus,</hi> drunkenneſſe is a preparatiue to vncleanneſſe, and as it were the wood or oyle wherewith this fire of luſt is kindled and nouriſhed. Now further he implieth, that they were not in any moderate ſort giuen to this ſinne; for hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubleth the word in the originall text; <hi>whoring, they who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:</hi> that is, they continually liued in this ſinne, without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or ſhame.</p>
               <p>And this alſo was an effectuall reaſon to withdraw the men of Iuda from their company, ſeeing they liued in an infamous and odious ſinne, and alſo were likely to infect and corrupt them by their wicked example; the ſinne of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:10737:332"/> being in it owne nature an infectious and ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſinne, apt to poiſon all who come neere them that are tainted and infected with it.</p>
               <p>The third &amp; laſt ſin is bribing &amp; extortion, in theſe words; <hi>Their rulers loue to ſay with ſhame,</hi> or ſhamefully; <hi>Bring ye.</hi> In which words we are to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the perſons who committed this ſin, and the ſin it ſelfe. The perſons were their rulers and magiſtrates. The word ſignifieth <hi>their ſhields:</hi> whereby is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; firſt the office and dutie of good magiſtrates; namely, to ſhield and defend their ſubiects from outward violence, iniuries, and oppreſſions: and ſecondly, the ſinne of theſe ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, &amp; the miſerable conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the people is hereby ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp; aggrauated; both in that the magiſtrates, whoſe chiefe care and ſtudie ſhould haue been to defend the people, to right their wrongs, to execute iudgement, and repell out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward iniuries, did greedily bend their mindes to couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, &amp; both forgetting their place, &amp; neglecting their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, gaped after bribes: &amp; alſo in that hereby, nothing could follow but horrible diſorder in the ſtate, when as thoſe who ſhould haue been the correctors and puniſhers of vice, and the rewarders of vertue, ſought onely their owne priuate gaine, and ſpent all their time and whole indeuours in hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting after bribes and rewards, as after a pray; whereby all manner of licentious libertie was giuen vnto the people of running headlong into all manner of ſinne, ſeeing their gouernours regarded them not; or though they ſhould call them into queſtion, yet they could eaſilie blinde their eyes, and ſtoppe their mouthes, and tie their hands with rewards and bribes.</p>
               <p>And theſe were the perſons. The ſinne is both expreſſed, and alſo exceedingly aggrauated. Their ſinne laid to their charge, is their bribing and extortion; which as it is in it ſelfe euill, ſo it is of worſe conſequence; for it vtterly peruerteth all iuſtice and righteous iudgement, and maketh thoſe who ſhould be vnpartiall Iudges, reſpecters of perſons; as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, Deut. 16. 19. <hi>The reward blindeth the eyes of the wiſe,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">

               <p> Now this their ſinne is aggrauated by their manner of committing of it, and that both in reſpect of their inward affection, and alſo their outward cariage and demeanure. For the former it is ſaid, not onely that they were content to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue gifts, when they were offered, but alſo that they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced this ſinne in their heart and affection, and were farre in loue with their vice; <hi>for they loued to ſay, Bring yee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For their outward cariage of it, it is ſaid, not only that they loued to receiue gifts when they were offered, and thruſt vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, but that they were growne to ſuch an height of impudencie and iniuſtice, that they did not ſticke openly to profeſſe their bribing, and by word of mouth to require re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, wringing and extorting from them gifts by direct ſpeeches, when either they would haue them winke at their faults, or adminiſter iudgement, or diſpatch their buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>Yea, and this they did not in any modeſt or ſhamefaſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but ſhamefully. The word here vſed may be referred ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the manner of their requiring rewards, that ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly and with a braſen forehead, they called for bribes, and couenanted before hand to haue rewards for any buſineſſe which they diſpatched; or it may be referred to the rewards which they required, namely, that they called for ſhamefull rewards, either in reſpect of their quantitie, that they requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red great rewards, for ſmall buſineſſes; or in reſpect of their qualitie, that they were the rewards of vnrighteouſneſſe, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and receiued for the betraying of iuſtice and truth, for the vpholding of the wicked, and diſcountenancing of the iuſt; for the cleering or acquitting of the faultie, and for the condemning of the innocent.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of the words. The doctrines which wee learne out of them are theſe: firſt, that drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The do∣ctrines. </seg>
                  </label> is an odious and loathſome vice which ſtrinketh in the <note place="margin">That drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe is an odious ſinne.</note> noſtrels of God and men. It is abominable to God, as in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other reſpects, ſo eſpecially becauſe the drunkard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his bellie his god, vnfitteth himſelfe for all duties of Gods worſhip and ſeruice, and moſt groſly and vngratefully abuſeth his good creatures, to the furthering of him in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:10737:333"/> as I haue elſewhere more largely prooued. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is loathſomely ſtinking before men; for not only do they offend mens eyes, in beholding their filthie cariage and behauiour, and their eares by their fooliſh railing or ribald ſpeeches, but alſo their ſmell, for their noiſome ſluttiſhnes euen infecteth the aire, and their very breath is a ſtrong ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to make this ſin odious, ſo that though there were no impietie in it, yet wee were to abhorre it becauſe it is ſo loathſome.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is, the ſame which the holy Ghoſt maketh in this place, namely, that it ſerue for a ſtrong diſſwaſion to reſtraine vs from ſuch companie as are addicted to this ſinne of drunkenneſſe; for not only are they to be auoided as wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <note place="margin">1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11.</note> men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both in regard of this ſinne it ſelfe, and all other abominable wickedneſſe which is the vſuall fruite thereof, leſt accompanying them we be allured to ioyne with them in their ſinne; but wee are to auoid theſe liuing carrions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they infect the aire with their breath, and annoy their companie with their loathſome ſlutriſhnes.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing which wee here learne is, that wee are <note place="margin">We muſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully auoid the companie of adulterers.</note> with like care to auoid the companie of ſuch as are addicted to the ſinne of whoredome, though wee had no other reaſon to reſtraine vs. For this the Lord himſelfe vſeth as an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall reaſon in this place, to diſſwade the men of Iuda from accompanying the Iſraelites, becauſe they continued in the ſinne of whoredome, wherewith they were likely to taint and infect thoſe who entertained neere familiaritie with them. The force of which reaſon will more cleerely appeare, if we conſider not onely that the euill example of vncleane perſons both by their ribald words, and vnchaſt behauiour, is apt to corrupt, and that in regard of our proneneſſe and naturall inclination to this vice, wee are as apt to be corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but alſo that adulterers haue many wiles to beguile vs, many baites to allure vs, and impudent foreheads in ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to giue the aſſault to our chaſtitie: as appeareth in the example of <hi>Ioſephs</hi> Miſtreſſe, who hauing gotten the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his companie, ſolicites him to this ſinne in a plaine
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:10737:334"/> and ſhameleſſe manner; in <hi>Lots</hi> daughters, who came to that height of impudencie, that they ſhamed not to intice their owne father; in the people of Iſrael, inueigled with the <note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is, that if wee deſire to preſerue our chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, we auoid the companie of adulterers and vncleane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſeeing in it ſelf it is ſufficient to corrupt vs, and to make vs copartners with them in this ſinne. For as there needeth no bellowes to blow the fire, when it toucheth gunpowder, becauſe the one is no more fit to fire, then the other to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed; ſo there needeth no other helpe to inflame the heart with luſt, then the touch and familiar acquaintance of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt perſons; becauſe as they are fit with the fire of their luſt to inflame vs, ſo wee carrie in our ſelues ſuch combuſtible matter, as is no leſſe readie to take the fire &amp; to be inflamed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we here learne that it is one of the higheſt degrees <note place="margin">That it is an high degree of wickednes to be in loue with ſinne.</note> of ſinne, when as we doe not only fall into wickedneſſe, but alſo grow into loue and liking with it: for this is the ſinne of the Princes of Iſrael in this place, who did not only bribe, but alſo tooke delight in bribing, and not only ſaid, but lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to ſay, <hi>Bring yee.</hi> Which as it argued that they had bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen faces, ſo alſo that their hearts were rotten, and wholly corrupted with ſinne. So long as the ſickneſſe is ſeated in the outward parts only, there is great hope of recouerie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe whileſt the heart is whole and ſound, it miniſtreth and conueigheth life, ſpirits and ſtrength to the exteriour mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, whereby they are inabled to incounter the diſeaſe, and in the end to expell it and get victorie; but if it haue once ſeazed vpon the heart, and taken thorough poſſeſſion of it, there is no hope of any recouerie; ſo whileſt our ſpirituall diſeaſes of ſinne enter no further then the imaginations,
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:10737:334"/> thoughts, words or outward actions, our hearts continuing ſound in their integritie &amp; vprightnes, there is aſſured hope, that they miniſtring continually ſpirituall life, and ſtrength, to all the reſt of the regenerate parts, they will in time expell the corrupt humours of ſinne, and obtaine a full conqueſt ouer theſe ſpirituall diſeaſes; but if ſinne haue taken poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the heart, ſo that hauing committed it, we like, and loue, and highly value it in our affections, then remaineth no hope of recouering ſpirituall health, or of eſcaping death and vtter deſtruction, vnleſſe the Lord cure vs by miracle, and taking away the corrupted heart out of our bodies, doe giue vnto vs new hearts which are ſound and vpright. It is the top of our perfection, and the fartheſt progreſſe which we can make in Chriſtianitie, when we cleaue vnto the Lord with all our hearts, louing him intirely, and our neighbour for his ſake, and when being inflamed with the fire of this holy loue, we labour to performe all good duties vnto them both, and take our chiefe delight in this performance; and ſo contrariwiſe it is one of the deepeſt degrees of ſin, when we ſet our hearts vpon it, and loue it as our deareſt darling, and not only willingly tranſgreſſe Gods commandements, but alſo delight in our tranſgreſſion. The firſt is an euident ſigne of the childe of God, though hee haue neuer ſo many infirmities and imperfections; the latter an apparent token of the childe of the diuell, though hee be graced with neuer ſo good a nature, neuer ſo many counterfeit morall vertues, neuer ſo glorious a ſhew of honeſtie and ciuilitie. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to thoſe that are regenerate to ſlippe into the puddle of ſinne; but being defiled, they are neuer at reſt till they be waſhed and cleanſed from their pollution with the blood of Chriſt, applied vnto them by a true and renued faith; but it is proper to the vnregenerate, after they are fallen into this filthie ſinck to wallow in it, and to take their chiefe delight in their pollution. It is incident to the faithfull to bee lead <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24.</note> captiue of ſinne, howbeit being in captiuitie they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer quiet till they come out of this thraldome, and obtaine deſired libertie; but it is peculiar to the wicked being made
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:10737:335"/> ſlaues to loue their bondage, and being impriſoned as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans vaſſals, to delight in their priſon, and to be in loue with their greues, ſetters and chaines of ſinne, wherewith they are held in his captiuitie. The godly may do the euil they would not, and neglect the good which they would do; neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, they take no pleaſure in their tranſgreſſions, but they are delighted in the law of God, in the inner man, and it is as ſweete vnto them, as the honie or hony combe; but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit wickednes with the full ſwinge and conſent of will, to loath vertue, and to be in loue with vice, to offend God, and to be well pleaſed when he is offended, is the diuels badge, whereby his ſeruants are knowne and diſtinguiſhed from the ſeruants of God.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we here obſerue, that the Lord condemneth it as a great ſin in the Rulers of Iſrael, to take bribes and rewards, in that not only thereby themſelues were corrupted, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the whole ſtate of gouernment diſioynted, and diſorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; becauſe their bribing peruerted iuſtice, and brought in impunitie, and together with it, all manner of ſin and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe. But of this ſinne my purpoſe is to ſpeake more largely elſewhere, and therefore I will heere paſſe it ouer.</p>

This ſimilitude is here contracted, but may be thus explicated; As the wind catcheth vp the chaffe, and carrieth it aloft with vnreſiſtable ſwiftnes, as though it were
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:10737:335"/> faſt bound vnto his wings; and hauing toſſed it to and fro, doth at laſt ſcatter it abroad vpon the earth: ſo the anger of God ſtirred vp with the ſinnes of the Iſraelites, ſhould ſeaze vpon them like a furious tempeſt, and ſcatter them here and there in a miſerable captiuitie, amongſt the Gentiles and nations, who ſhould be Lords ouer them.</p>
               <p>The perſons then thus to be ſcattered, were the people of Iſrael, ſignified by this word <hi>(them)</hi> which in the originall is expreſſed in the feminine gender, and ſingular number, <hi>liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit eam,</hi> hath bound her, towit, the nation of the Iſraelites, or the tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> of which the former words are to be vnderſtood. The meanes whereby they ſhould be thus ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, was the winde of Gods furie and fierce diſpleaſure, prouoked by their ſinnes.</p>
               <p>The like allegorie is vſed, Iob 21. 18. Pſal. 1. 4. where it is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Job</hi> 21. 18. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Ezech.</hi> 5. 3.</note> ſaid, that <hi>the wicked are as chaffe, which the winde driueth away,</hi> Ezech. 5. 3. Now the cauſe why he vſeth this ſimilitude, was not only becauſe theſe darke ſpeeches were fit for a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, which is as a booke ſealed vp, vntill it be opened and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the euent; but alſo becauſe in theſe few words, being rightly vnderſtood, thoſe heauie iudgements which were inflicted vpon the Iſraelites, were moſt fully and fitly ſignified. For firſt, hereby is implied the ſuddenneſſe of this iudgement which ſhould befall them, when they leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it: for as a foule ſtorme ſuddenly followeth a faire calme; and the winde which commeth we know not from whence, ruſheth vpon vs with vnexpected ſpeed: ſo the Lord ſurprizeth the Iſraelites at vnawares, with his heauie puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a miſerable captiuitie, and whileſt they pampered themſelues with the fleſhly pleaſures of drunkenneſſe and vncleanneſſe, and hoarded vp the riches of iniquitie by bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and extortion, as though they were aſſured that they ſhould neuer be diſpoſſeſſed of them; euen then ſuddenly the wrath of God attached them, and brought vpon them the Aſſyrians, who ſpoiled the land, and led them into cruel bondage.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hereby is implied the ſwiftneſſe of this iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:10737:336"/> which is here compared to the ſwiftnes of the winde, and that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it goeth on Gods meſſage with poſting ſpeed; for as though the ſwiftnes of the winde were not quicke e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, to expreſſe the ſpeedines of Gods vengeance, he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth wings vnto it, to double (as it were) his haſt. And thus this ſimilitude is commonly vſed to ſignifie the haſtie ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe of an action. So when <hi>Dauid</hi> would in liuely manner expreſſe the ſpeedie ſwiftnes, which the Lord vſeth in aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting his ſeruants, and deſtroying his enemies, he ſaith, that <hi>He rode vpon the Cherub and did flie, and he came flying vpon the wings of the winde,</hi> Pſal. 18. 10. 2.

               <p>Thirdly, hereby is implied, that this iudgement ſhould come vpon them with ſuch vnreſiſtable furie, that they ſhould not be able by any meanes to withſtand it; and this is ſignified, whereas it is ſaid, that the winde ſhould binde them in his wings, that is, as they who are bound hand and foote are vtterly vnable to make reſiſtance; ſo they ſhould bee ſo ouermatched and hampered by the Aſſyrians, that it ſhould be but folly to ſtriue againſt their ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, ſeeing they ſhould be debarred of all meanes, whereby they might ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther defend themſelues, or offend the enemie. And thus the vnreſiſtable power of the Chaldeans is at large deſcribed, Ioel. 1. 6. 7. &amp; 2. 2. 3. &amp;c. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joel.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. 2. 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, hereby is ſignified the nature of their captiuitie, namely, that being led away by their enemies, they ſhould not haue any ſet place, wherein they might reſt and aſſemble themſelues together, for the performance of ciuill and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine duties; but that they ſhould be toſſed to and fro, from poſt to pillar, and be ſcattered and diſperſed one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the land of their captiuitie, amongſt the Gentiles and nations, as the winde ſcattereth the chaffe vpon the face of the earth.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the certaintie of this iudgement is here expreſſed,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:10737:336"/> in that he doth not vſe the future tenſe, as ſpeaking of a thing to be done in time to come, but the perfect tenſe, as though it were to come vpon them with ſuch vndoubted certaintie, that it ſeemed to be as it were done alreadie. So Ioh. 3. 36. <hi>He</hi>

               <p>And ſo much concerning the firſt puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. The ſecond is ſhame and confuſion, in theſe words, <hi>And they ſhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of their ſacrifices.</hi> The which puniſhment is an effect of the former: for when as they were brought into great ſtraites and grieuous calamities, and could haue no helpe or reliefe from the idols which they had ſerued, then they were aſhamed, when they conſidered that they had ſpent all their labour and coſt in vaine. Whileſt idolaters flouriſh in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, they flatter themſelues in their ſins, &amp; become here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by more obſtinate in their ſuperſtition; imagining that they are priuiledged from Gods iudgements, and haue the frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all his bleſſings, for their falſe worſhip ſake: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hand of God lieth heauie vpon them, and when he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth (as it were) to fight with them from heauen, by infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting vpon them grieuous afflictions; then they double their deuotions and ſuperſtitions vnto their idols, that by their helpe they may be deliuered: but when they find their hope fruſtrate, and that they are forſaken of their idols when they moſt neede their helpe, then at length they acknowledge their impotencie and inſufficiencie, &amp; are confounded with ſhame, when they ſee that their gods, in whom they gloried, faile them, and that they haue ſpent vpon them ſo much vnrewarded coſt, and bootleſſe labour. The puniſhment then here denounced is ſhame and confuſion; the cauſe of this ſhame, is their ſacrifices, not ſuch as they offered vnto the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:10737:337"/> true God, in ſuch manner and forme as hee had preſcribed in his word, which alwaies bring boldneſſe, confidence, and aſſured hope of helpe and deliuerance; according to that Pſalme 25. 3. <hi>All that hope in thee ſhall not bee aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 3.</note> but heere hee vnderſtandeth ſuch ſacrifices as were offered vnto idols, according vnto their owne wills and inuentions; and therefore hee calleth them <hi>their ſacrifices:</hi> that is, ſacrifices of their owne deuiſing and inuenting; whereby alſo hee doth ſynecdochically vnderſtand all their falſe worſhip and idolatry, whereby they ſerued falſe gods.</p>
               <p>And this is the meaning of the wordes. The doctrines <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">The Do∣ctrines. </seg>
                  </label> which ariſe out of them are theſe. Firſt, we may obſerue, that voluptuouſneſſe and couetouſneſſe, are the cauſes and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runners <note place="margin">Voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe, are the cauſes and forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</note> of confuſion and deſtruction: for when a people goe on ſecurely in the fruition of ſinfull pleaſures, and greedily giue themſelues to all manner of couetous courſes, which ſeeme to promiſe them any gaine, as though they imagined that they ſhould for euer liue vpon the earth; then Gods iudgements with winged ſpeed ſhall attach them, and bring them to ſhame and vtter ruine. So when the people of Iſrael polluted themſelues with thoſe filthy pleaſures of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe and whoredome, and when their rulers greedily gaped after gaine, defiling their hearts with couetouſneſſe, and their hands with bribes; the Lord threatneth that he will ſurprize them and carry them away, as it were, in the whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind of his wrath, when they leaſt of all ſuſpected any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.

And latter experience hath taught vs, that as the Roman Empire increaſed and flouriſhed, whileſt they vſed ſeuerer diſcipline, ſobrietie, temperance, bountie, and homely grauitie, euery one neglecting their owne particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, to benefit their Country, and aduance the good of the Commonwealth; ſo, when they effeminately did ſpend their times in voluptuous pleaſures, wanton luxuriouſneſſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue pride and brauerie; and to maintaine themſelues in theſe prodigall courſes, greedily ſcraped from the Common-wealth to inrich their priuate houſes, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance their owne eſtate; they hauing firſt made themſelues ſlaues to their wanton luſts, afterwards became ſlaues to their cruell enemies; and loſing that through intemperancy and couetouſnes, which their anceſtors had wone by ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, continency, and frugality, of the conquerours of the world, they became the vnderlings and vaſſals of the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Gothes and Vandals.</p>
               <p>And this muſt needes come to paſſe, both in reſpect of Gods righteous iudgements, with whom it is iuſt to puniſh abuſed proſperitie with wretched aduerſitie, waſtefull pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digalitie with extreame beggery, haughtineſſe and pride with an abiect and baſe condition, oppreſſion with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and tyranny with ſlauerie: and alſo in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ciuill pollicie; for as on the one ſide pleaſures make men proud, wanton, impatient, diſcontent, and inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in offering wrongs and iniuries, by all which they exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate others, and procure againſt themſelues many impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable enemies; ſo alſo they effeminate the minde, and ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the body, that they are not able to vphold themſelues in their vniuſt courſes againſt the leaſt violence, but become an eaſie pray to their incenſed enemies, when they go about
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:10737:338"/> to right their owne wrongs, and to repay their iniuries with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uſt reuenge.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is, that it ſerue as a warning to the people <note place="margin">That our land is much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with voluptuous pleaſures and couetouſneſſe.</note> of this our land, which is exceedingly corrupted with theſe ſinnes; that they turne from theſe wicked courſes by true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, that ſo they may bee reconciled vnto God, and preuent the like fearefull iudgements, vnto which they are liable, being defiled with the like wickedneſſe. For hath not our long peace and proſperitie brought an vniuerſall ſleepe of ſecuritie vpon the land? Haue not our people greeuouſly abuſed their great plenty, and the manifold bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings wherewith God hath inriched them, by miſ-ſpending them in voluptuous pleaſures, and in all manner of luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wantonneſſe and intemperance? Was euer the land ſo defiled with ſurfetting and drunkenneſſe, whordome, and all manner of vncleanneſſe? Was there euer the like greedy co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſneſſe, oppreſſion, bribing, extortion, and all manner deceitfull &amp; cruell dealing? Were euer the hearts and hands of our Nation ſo effeminated, as in theſe times, wherein there is ſcarce any difference betweene men and women in nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, wantonneſſe, and ſoft luxuriouſneſſe, both in reſpect of diet and attire? Is not the manly courage, and able valour of this our Nation much decaied, and doth not foxe-like wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe take the place of true fortitude? Finally, were euer men more inſolent in offering iniuries, or more impotent in repelling deſerued reuenge? What therefore can remaine but a miſerable concluſion of all theſe premiſes? what can we expect, but that as we haue matched, and ſurpaſſed thoſe who haue gone before vs, in voluptuouſnes, intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and couetouſneſſe; wee ſhould alſo be like vnto them in puniſhment, confuſion, and deſtruction, vnleſſe wee ſpeedily preuent Gods iudgements by vnfained repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and auert theſe puniſhments by turning from our ſinnes?</p>
               <p>Secondly, we may here obſerue, that howſoeuer the Lord <note place="margin">The Lords patience en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in wrath towards the impenitent.</note> in his infinite patience and long ſuffering, deferreth the iuſt
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:10737:338"/> puniſhment of wicked men and ſinfull nations, to the end that hereby they may be drawne to repentance, &amp; ſo eſcape his plagues; yet when notwithſtanding all this mercie and patience of God, they continue in their hainous tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Lord bringeth his iudgements like a whirle-winde, and taketh them away in a tempeſt of his wrath; as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the example of the Iſraelites in this place. More pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <note place="margin">Puniſhment commeth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wicked ſuddenly.</note> the puniſhments of the wicked, which haue been long deferred, ſhall at length come vpon them ſuddenly, and when they leaſt expect any danger; euen as the ſtorme doth ſuddenly follow the calme. To this purpoſe it is ſaid; that <hi>Though the excellencie of the wicked mount vp to heauen, and his head reach vnto the clouds; yet ſhall he periſh for euer, like his dung, and they which haue ſeene him ſhall ſay, Where is he? He ſhall flee away as a dreame, and they ſhall not finde him, and ſhall paſſe away as a viſion in the night:</hi> Iob 20. 6, 7, 8. And <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Job</hi> 20. 6, 7, 8. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21. 13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. 19.</note> Chap. 21. 13. <hi>They ſpend their daies in wealth, and ſuddenly they goe downe to the graue.</hi> So Pſal. 73. 19. <hi>How ſuddenly are they destroyed, periſhed, and horribly conſumed, as a dreame when one awaketh!</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> compareth the deſtruction of the wicked to the ruines of a wall, which though it ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a long time, yet it ſuddenly falleth and in a moment: Eſa. 30. 13. <hi>Therefore this iniquity ſhall be vnto you as a breach</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 30. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>that falleth, or as a ſwelling in an high wall, whoſe breaking com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſuddenly and in a moment.</hi> Examples whereof we haue in the old world, and in <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> who whileſt they ſecurely inioyed their voluptuous pleaſures without feare of any danger, were ſuddenly ſurprized with Gods iudgements, euen with the generall deluge, &amp; with fire and brimſtone deſcending downe from heauen. So when <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzer</hi> gloried in his power and maieſtie, it is ſaid, that whileſt the word was yet in his mouth, the meſſage of Gods anger was deliuered vnto him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as the winde is ſo ſwift that it is impoſſible to <note place="margin">Gods iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſwift and vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoidable.</note> flee away from it, though we runne vpon our greateſt ſpeed; ſo the iudgements of God purſue the wicked with ſuch po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting haſt, that it is impoſſible for them to eſcape, though
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:10737:339"/> they be as ſwift as the Hinde in the forreſt, or the Swallow in the aire. To this purpoſe it is ſaid, Matth. 3. 5. <hi>I will come</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>neere to you to iudgement, and I will be a ſwift witneſſe against the ſoothſaiers,</hi> &amp;c. And 2. Pet. 2. 1. the Apoſtle ſaith, that <note place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1.</note> the lying Prophets by their falſe teaching <hi>brought vpon themſelues ſwift damnation.</hi> So when the Lord would bring vpon the men of Iuda deſtruction and deſolation, he ſaith, that their enemies ſhould come vp againſt them as the cloudes, his chariots as tempeſts, and that his Horſes ſhould be lighter than the Eagles: Iere. 4. 13. And therefore though <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ier.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 46. 6.</note> they were neuer ſo ſwift, yet they ſhould not be able to flee away: as he alſo ſpeaketh Chap. 46. 6. for either the flight ſhould periſh from the ſwift, as it is Amos 2. 14. or if they <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Amos</hi> 2. 14.</note> continued in their ſwiftneſſe, their perſecuters ſhould bee ſwifter, as the Lord threatneth, Eſa. 30. 16. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 30. 16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, as the winde or tempeſt carrieth away the duſt <note place="margin">Wicked men cannot reſiſt when God puniſheth.</note> and chaffe with ſuch vnreſiſtable furie, that it is altogether impoſſible for it by any waight or ſtrength it hath to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine together vndiſperſed; ſo the iudgements of God doe ſurprize the wicked with ſuch force and violence, that it is not poſſible for them with their greateſt power to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſiſtance, but their deſtruction ſhall be vnto them alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnrecouerable. In which reſpect the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eſa.</hi> 30. 13, 14.</note> the iudgements of God falling vpon wicked men, to the ruines of a wall; for as before it falleth, it may eaſilie be vnderpropped and repaired, but when it is in falling, it cannot be ſtaied by any force of man; ſo howſoeuer it is no hard thing to preuent the iudgements of God from ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon vs before they attach vs, if we forſake our ſinnes by true repentance; yt if the ſentence bee paſt, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments haue alreadie begunne to ſeaze vpon vs, then is our caſe deſperate and vnrecouerable, ſeeing we are not able to make any reſiſtance, hor to withſtand them with our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt power. And hence alſo it is that in the ſame place hee compareth the wicked to a Potters pot, which is ſo brittle that it is broken with the leaſt violence, and being broken, cannot be amended nor ſerue for any vſe, Eſa. 30. 13, 14. to
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:10737:339"/> the ſame purpoſe it is ſaid, Prou. 6. 15. That the wicked man <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 6. 15.</note> ſhall be deſtroyed ſuddainely, and without recouerie: and that as the ſwift ſhould not ſcape by flight, ſo neither the ſtrong man by his ſtrength, Ierem. 46. 6. So Amos 2. 14. <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iere.</hi> 46. 6. <hi>Amos</hi> 2. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>The flight ſhall periſh from the ſwift, and the ſtrong ſhall not ſtrengthen his force neither ſhall the mightie ſaue his life.</hi> And in this reſpect the wrath of God in this place, is compared to a ſtrong winde, and the wicked to chaffe which is ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by it. So Iob. 21. 18. <hi>They ſhall be as ſtubble before the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Job</hi> 21. 18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>winde, and as chaffe that the ſtorme carrieth away:</hi> Pſalm. 1. 4.</p>
               <p>The vſe hereof is, that when being guiltie of ſinne, wee heare the iudgements of God denounced againſt vs, wee doe earneſtly repent of our wickedneſſe, flee vnto the throne of grace, ſubmit our ſelues vnder Gods hands, and humblie ſue for pardon and forgiueneſſe, ſeeing it is the onely courſe wee can take to ſecure vs, from being ouerwhelmed with Gods plagues. For if we flee from the Lord, his iudgements ſhall purſue vs with vnexpected ſpeede, and ſhall ouertake vs like the ſwift winde in our greateſt haſt; and if we ſtruggle and ſtriue againſt them, they will ouerthrowe vs with vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtable violence, and like a furious tempeſt they will carrie vs away as duſt or chaffe.</p>
               <p>The laſt thing to be obſerued is the puniſhment of idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie <note place="margin">Idolatrie is puniſhed with ſhame and confuſion.</note> and ſuperſtition; for howſoeuer idolaters whileſt they proſper in their ſuperſtition and falſe worſhip, glorie in their idols, and aſcribe all the benefits which they haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued vnto them, and their owne idolatrous deuotions, yet when the Lord thundereth againſt them from heauen with his iudgements, and bringeth vpon them afflictions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extricable calamities, and when for the remouing of theſe euils, they haue long ſued vnto their idols for helpe in vaine, then are they couered and ouerwhelmed with ſhame and confuſion, then doe they with deſperate ſorrow bewaile their former follies, and their booteleſſe deuotions, and caſt away from them their images as vnprofitable, wherein for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they placed their chiefeſt confidence. And this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion as it is here poynted at by our Prophet, ſo is it in
